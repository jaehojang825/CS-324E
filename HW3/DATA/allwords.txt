i
were
it
not
that
the
most
common
of
all
inquiries
respecting
every
man
who
comes
before
the
public
is
who
is
he
whence
did
he
proceed
who
were
his
parents
c
i
would
not
detain
the
reader
with
any
account
of
my
humble
ancestors
and
their
circumstances
but
since
men
naturally
expect
this
information
and
would
hence
consider
my
narrative
imperfect
without
it
i
shall
take
the
liberty
to
introduce
them
my
father’s
occupation
was
that
of
valet
de
chambre
to
lord
william
fitzroy
son
of
the
duke
of
grafton
my
recollections
concerning
him
are
few
and
indistinct
as
he
died
while
i
was
yet
scarcely
three
years
old
one
little
incident
alone
reminds
me
of
wearing
a
mourning
dress
as
a
memento
of
sorrow
for
his
death
returning
from
the
parish
church
in
walthamstow
i
observed
the
larger
boys
amusing
themselves
by
swinging
across
the
rails
of
the
fences
endeavoring
to
join
in
their
amusement
my
hands
slipped
and
falling
into
a
muddy
ditch
i
nearly
finished
my
course
ere
it
was
well
begun
by
a
violent
death
a
benevolent
stranger
however
rescued
me
and
once
safe
my
grief
for
the
sad
condition
of
my
little
black
frock
was
excessive
and
inconsolable
a
trifling
cause
for
sorrow
to
be
sure
yet
men
and
women
often
grieve
for
causes
equally
contemptible
although
my
personal
remembrances
of
my
father’s
death
are
so
indistinct
yet
the
frequent
mention
made
of
him
by
my
mother
has
left
the
pleasing
impression
on
my
mind
that
he
died
a
christian
i
have
thought
of
my
numerous
sins
but
god
has
forgiven
them
all
be
not
troubled
for
the
lord
will
provide
for
you
and
your
children
you
need
not
fear
to
leave
me
for
i
am
not
alone
god
is
with
me
though
you
are
out
of
the
room
were
among
his
dying
expressions
when
after
fourteen
months
endurance
of
the
pains
which
accompany
a
slow
consumption
he
approached
that
bourne
from
which
no
traveller
returns
i
expect
to
find
my
honored
father
in
heaven
wanstead
in
essex
about
seven
miles
from
the
great
metropolis
of
england
was
the
town
and
1798
the
year
of
my
birth
were
it
necessary
to
designate
the
place
more
particularly
it
might
be
said
that
the
part
of
wanstead
where
i
first
struggled
into
being
was
called
nightingale
place
a
most
musical
name
conferred
in
honor
of
the
nightingales
which
abounded
in
the
vicinity
two
years
subsequently
to
my
father’s
demise
my
mother
became
an
inmate
of
the
family
of
lady
francis
spencer
daughter
of
the
duke
of
grafton
and
wife
of
lord
spencer
as
a
consequence
of
this
event
i
was
deprived
of
a
mother’s
care
and
consigned
to
the
charge
of
my
aunt
turner
whose
family
amounted
to
the
very
respectable
number
of
twenty-two
sons
and
two
daughters
the
transfer
of
a
child
from
the
care
of
its
parent
to
that
of
another
person
may
appear
at
first
sight
to
be
a
very
unimportant
incident
but
trifling
as
it
seems
it
often
exerts
an
influence
which
very
materially
changes
the
destiny
of
the
child
it
was
so
in
my
case
most
of
my
cousins
were
sailors
and
some
of
them
were
constantly
returning
home
bringing
with
true
sailors’
munificence
the
pleasing
and
curious
productions
of
distant
climes
as
presents
to
their
parents
and
friends
then
seated
round
the
bright
hearth-side
they
used
to
tell
of
wild
adventures
and
hair-breadth
escapes
spinning
out
the
winter
evening’s
tale
to
the
infinite
delight
of
their
willing
listeners
poor
fellows
three
of
them
died
at
sea
two
more
john
and
richard
perished
in
the
ill-fated
blenheim
a
seventy-four
gun
ship
of
the
british
navy
which
went
down
off
the
cape
of
good
hope
with
seven
hundred
as
brave
men
on
board
as
ever
trod
a
plank
notwithstanding
these
sad
recollections
and
though
none
perceived
it
my
three
years’
residence
among
these
sailors
bold
decided
the
nature
of
my
future
calling
it
captivated
my
imagination
and
begat
a
curiosity
which
ultimately
led
me
to
make
my
home
upon
the
bounding
deep
an
orphan
is
ever
exposed
to
changes
the
loss
of
either
parent
calls
for
a
degree
of
sympathy
and
kindness
from
others
which
they
are
rarely
willing
to
expend
except
on
their
own
such
is
the
almost
universal
selfishness
of
human
nature
my
experience
affords
a
verification
of
the
truthfulness
of
the
remark
for
some
cause
or
other
it
became
inconvenient
for
me
to
remain
with
my
kind
aunt
turner
and
my
next
home
was
with
a
widowed
aunt
at
wanstead
where
i
did
not
meet
with
the
same
kindness
of
treatment
the
breaking
of
a
cup
or
any
of
the
thousand-and-one
offences
found
in
the
list
of
juvenile
defects
was
sure
to
bring
upon
me
the
infliction
of
the
rod
and
what
was
equally
painful
my
most
economical
aunt
exacted
the
full
payment
for
all
these
losses
from
the
little
pocket
money
i
obtained
by
holding
a
horse
running
errands
or
as
new-year
and
christmas
presents
thus
gratifying
her
temper
and
her
covetousness
at
once
besides
embittering
to
some
extent
the
boyish
hours
of
my
unfortunate
self
there
is
no
evil
in
the
management
of
children
to
be
more
deprecated
than
that
species
of
treatment
which
tends
to
destroy
their
happiness
correction
for
obvious
faults
in
a
proper
manner
is
essential
to
their
proper
moral
training
but
a
habit
of
incessantly
scolding
them
for
every
little
accident
or
offence
only
serves
to
excite
the
growth
of
evil
passions
and
to
make
them
dislike
their
home
things
to
be
avoided
as
much
as
scylla
and
charybdis
by
the
careful
mariner
the
influence
of
such
mal-treatment
follows
the
child
through
life
like
an
evil
genius
materially
affecting
his
views
of
life
and
the
temper
of
his
mind
for
aught
that
now
occurs
to
me
but
for
this
unkindness
my
early
predilection
for
the
sea
would
have
died
within
me
while
as
it
was
i
panted
to
enjoy
the
freedom
my
fancy
painted
in
its
pictures
of
sailor
life
to
add
to
my
sorrows
my
mother
removed
my
sister
who
had
been
my
cheerful
companion
and
true
friend
to
a
lady’s
school
at
woodstock
in
oxfordshire
for
the
twofold
purpose
of
affording
her
greater
literary
advantages
and
of
being
able
to
see
her
more
frequently
several
incidents
occurred
during
my
abode
here
which
tended
to
increase
my
growing
desire
a
smart
active
sailor
over
six
feet
in
height
and
well-proportioned
one
day
presented
himself
at
my
aunt’s
door
he
told
us
he
had
been
to
america
where
he
had
seen
a
young
man
named
george
turner
who
was
her
nephew
and
my
cousin
he
proceeded
to
tell
many
fine
stories
about
him
and
at
last
inquired
if
she
should
not
like
to
see
him
and
if
she
should
know
him
i
don’t
know
as
i
should
said
my
aunt
he
has
been
away
so
long
well
then
replied
he
i
am
george
turner
this
fine
bold
seaman
then
was
my
own
cousin
son
to
my
aunt
turner
he
had
been
eleven
years
at
sea
and
after
visiting
his
parents
took
this
method
of
surprising
his
aunt
most
likely
he
has
made
this
adventure
the
subject
of
many
a
forecastle
yarn
since
then
while
he
remained
he
was
so
jolly
so
liberal
and
so
full
of
pleasant
stories
that
i
began
to
feel
quite
sure
that
sailors
were
noble
fellows
we
were
also
favored
with
a
visit
from
an
uncle
then
visiting
europe
from
the
west
indies
he
was
one
of
two
brothers
who
were
educated
at
greenwich
for
the
navy
one
of
them
had
entered
the
british
navy
and
by
dint
of
merit
and
hard
service
rose
to
the
possession
of
a
commission
in
the
service
but
ultimately
perished
at
sea
this
one
had
chosen
the
merchant
service
but
afterwards
settled
at
antigua
he
took
me
with
him
to
london
and
carried
me
over
the
west
india
docks
he
being
well
acquainted
with
many
of
the
captains
they
treated
me
with
playful
attention
inquiring
if
i
did
not
wish
to
be
a
cabin-boy
and
the
like
when
i
returned
to
wanstead
it
was
with
a
stronger
desire
than
ever
to
be
a
sailor
my
uncle
went
to
trinidad
and
died
shortly
after
a
very
pleasant
piece
of
intelligence
greeted
me
soon
after
these
incidents
it
was
nothing
less
than
my
removal
from
the
care
of
my
unkind
aunt
to
the
roof
of
my
mother
weary
of
her
widowhood
she
had
again
become
a
wife
my
new
parent
was
a
widower
with
one
son
a
carpenter
by
occupation
in
the
employ
of
the
duke
of
marlborough
great
was
my
joy
when
this
fact
was
communicated
to
my
young
mind
i
hailed
it
as
a
deliverance
from
bondage
and
with
beaming
eyes
and
cheerful
face
hurried
to
bid
adieu
to
my
classmates
in
the
day
and
in
the
sunday
school--a
sad
proof
of
the
unfitness
of
my
aunt
for
her
task
since
a
child
properly
treated
will
love
its
home
too
well
to
quit
it
without
a
tear
and
if
parents
and
guardians
wish
to
prevent
their
children
from
being
wanderers
and
stragglers
through
the
wide
world
let
me
bid
them
exert
the
utmost
effort
to
make
their
home
pleasant
throw
a
charm
round
it
make
it
enchanted
ground
cause
it
to
become
in
the
language
of
a
living
poet
the
fairy
ring
of
bliss
and
then
your
children
will
love
it
too
well
to
wander
but
i
was
now
about
to
leave
wanstead
and
although
delighted
to
be
rid
of
the
surveillance
of
a
cross
old
relation
there
were
some
things
which
threw
an
air
of
sadness
occasionally
over
my
mind
there
were
many
pleasant
associations
connected
with
the
place
its
beautiful
park
with
herds
of
timid
deer
grazing
under
its
tall
oaks
upon
whose
green
old
heads
the
sun
had
shone
for
centuries
the
venerable
mansion
seated
like
a
queen
amid
the
sylvan
scene
the
old
parish
church
with
its
gorgeously
painted
windows
to
which
i
had
often
walked
on
the
sabbath
with
my
fellow-scholars
in
the
sabbath
school
and
beside
whose
deep-toned
organ
i
had
sat
listening
to
the
learned
priest
the
annual
hunt
at
easter
in
which
i
had
often
joined
the
crew
of
idle
lads
that
gave
chase
to
the
distracted
deer
and
the
pleasant
walks
made
cheerful
by
the
songs
of
innumerable
birds
in
epping
forest
were
all
to
be
left--perhaps
forever
this
thought
made
me
somewhat
sad
but
it
was
swallowed
up
in
the
joy
i
felt
when
my
mother
appeared
to
conduct
me
to
bladen
some
sixty
miles
from
london
which
was
the
place
of
her
abode
since
her
marriage
behold
me
then
gentle
reader
seated
with
my
mother
on
the
outside
of
a
stage-coach
with
some
ten
fellow-passengers
the
stage-coach
of
england
is
quite
a
different
vehicle
from
the
carriage
known
by
that
name
in
america
true
it
is
drawn
by
four
horses
and
it
runs
on
four
wheels
but
here
the
likeness
ends
instead
of
being
built
to
carry
twelve
persons
inside
it
carries
but
six
while
outside
it
has
seats
for
twelve
three
or
four
passengers
ride
very
comfortably
behind
in
what
is
called
the
basket
which
is
the
territory
of
the
guard
as
the
boot
before
is
of
the
coachman
all
mail
coaches
and
all
others
travelling
in
the
night
carry
a
guard
or
an
armed
man
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
coach
from
the
attacks
of
footpads
or
highway
robbers
the
dullness
of
our
journey
was
somewhat
relieved
after
a
long
season
of
silence
by
the
distress
of
an
unfortunate
passenger
who
falling
asleep
nodded
so
violently
that
his
hat
supposing
it
was
receiving
notice
to
quit
very
unceremoniously
took
leave
of
the
skull
it
covered
and
plunged
into
the
mud
the
outcry
of
the
poor
passenger
who
was
soon
waked
by
the
wind
sporting
amid
his
hair
and
his
unavailing
requests
to
stop
the
stage
put
us
all
into
good
humor
with
ourselves
and
with
each
other
we
had
another
source
of
relief
in
the
antics
of
a
wild
hair-brained
sailor
from
spinning
yarns
which
looked
amazingly
like
new
inventions
he
would
take
to
dancing
on
the
roof
of
the
coach
at
the
foot
of
a
hill
he
would
leap
off
and
then
spring
up
again
with
the
agility
of
a
monkey
to
the
no
small
amusement
of
the
passengers
the
more
i
saw
of
this
reckless
thoughtless
tar
the
more
enamored
i
became
with
the
idea
of
a
sea
life
and
thus
this
journey
to
my
mother’s
new
abode
was
another
link
in
the
chain
that
decided
my
future
destiny
in
the
drama
of
life
how
strangely
and
imperceptibly
do
small
events
tend
to
unexpected
results
a
match
may
fire
a
city
and
lay
desolate
the
work
of
ages
a
single
leak
may
sink
a
bark
and
carry
desolation
to
a
hundred
firesides--and
trifles
in
the
daily
scenes
of
human
life
give
character
to
our
immortality
we
cannot
therefore
too
carefully
watch
the
influence
of
small
events
especially
on
young
minds
at
woodstock
famed
in
the
annals
of
england
as
the
scene
of
the
loves
of
king
henry
and
rosamond
clifford
we
quitted
our
stage
companions
and
proceeded
on
foot
to
bladen
two
miles
distant
our
road
lay
through
blenheim
or
woodstock
park
which
we
entered
through
the
triumphal
arch
a
spacious
portal
erected
to
the
memory
of
john
duke
of
marlborough
by
sarah
his
duchess
on
entering
the
park
which
is
nearly
twelve
miles
in
circumference
one
of
the
most
beautiful
prospects
imaginable
disclosed
itself
blenheim
palace
which
is
among
the
most
magnificent
piles
of
architecture
in
england
appeared
in
front
on
the
left
were
to
be
seen
a
part
of
the
village
of
woodstock
and
on
the
right
a
broad
and
spacious
lake
crossed
by
a
superb
bridge;[1
a
lofty
column
on
the
rising
ground
erected
in
honor
of

palace
or
castle
was
built
at
the
public
expense
in
the
reign
of

anne
and
was
given
with
its
annexed
demesnes
in
concurrence
with
the
voice
of
parliament
to
john
duke
of
marlborough
as
a
testimony
of
royal
favor
and
national
gratitude
for
his
successes
over
the
french
and
bavarians
particularly
for
his
victory
at
blenheim
on
the
banks
of
the
danube
on
the
2d
of
august
1704
crossing
the
park
towards
bladen
we
were
met
by
my
father-in-law,[2
who
received
me
with
a
kindness
which
prepossessed
me
at
once
in
his
favor
he
conducted
us
home
where
to
my
no
small
gratification
i
met
my
sister
my
father-in-law
appeared
to
be
in
comfortable
circumstances
he
resided
in
a
very
neat
house
built
of
stone
shaded
by
a
noble
apricot
tree
and
ornamented
with
a
small
but
pretty
garden
this
together
with
another
similar
tenement
was
his
own
property
to
add
to
my
satisfaction
i
perceived
that
he
was
very
kind
to
my
mother
and
also
to
myself
she
one
day
expressed
a
desire
to
have
the
cold
stone
floor
of
the
kitchen
removed
and
boarded
instead
my
father
at
considerable
expense
gratified
her
wish
this
assured
me
of
his
regard
for
her
comfort
with
the
village
itself
i
was
equally
well
pleased
though
containing
few
houses
it
was
delightfully
pleasant
fine
farms
with
large
flocks
of
quiet
sheep
grazing
on
their
hill-sides
expansive
fields
surrounded
with
fragrant
hawthorn
hedges
and
old
farm-houses
with
their
thatched
roofs
and
massive
wheat
ricks
met
the
pleased
eye
on
all
sides
while
cultivated
gardens
and
numerous
wild
flowers
especially
the
modest
cowslip
and
humble
violet
scented
the
air
and
perfumed
the
breeze
thus
far
perhaps
bladen
was
equal
to
wanstead
but
in
its
moral
aspects
it
was
inferior
there
was
far
less
regard
for
the
sabbath
less
attention
to
the
moral
culture
of
the
young
than
at
the
latter
place
that
blessed
institution
which
has
vivified
and
renewed
the
church
which
has
filled
her
with
the
vigorous
pulsations
of
youth--from
which
as
from
some
prolific
nursery
she
has
obtained
the
plants
which
now
stand
on
her
mountain-tops
like
the
tall
cedars
of
lebanon--the
modest
unassuming
sabbath
school
was
not
there
consequently
the
sabbath
was
spent
in
roaming
about
the
fields
in
amusements
in
visiting
in
taking
excursions
to
a
place
called
ramsden
some
seven
miles
distant
true
there
was
a
parish
church
with
two
clergymen
belonging
to
its
altars
but
there
was
service
only
once
every
sunday
within
its
ancient
walls
during
lent
however
both
priests
and
people
were
more
religious
the
church
was
better
attended
the
children
were
examined
as
to
their
knowledge
of
the
church
catechism
they
were
even
excited
to
diligence
in
committing
it
to
memory
by
the
inducement
of
reward
a
bible
and
two
prayer
books
were
given
to
the
lads
who
excelled
in
answering
the
questions
at
the
first
lent
examination
after
my
coming
to
bladen
the
bible
the
highest
prize
was
awarded
to
me
and
the
second
year
the
minister
assigned
me
the
task
of
hearing
the
others
recite--a
striking
proof
of
the
benefit
of
sunday
school
instruction
it
gave
me
both
a
moral
and
mental
superiority
over
all
my
compeers
in
the
little
village
of
bladen
this
special
attention
to
religion
only
lasted
during
the
term
of
lent
when
with
a
return
to
the
use
of
meat
the
people
returned
to
the
neglect
of
the
sabbath
the
inhabitants
of
bladen
were
very
social
in
their
habits
they
held
an
annual
feast
called
bladen
feast
to
which
they
invited
their
friends
from
other
towns
it
commenced
on
sabbath
and
continued
three
days
eating
drinking
talking
fortune-telling
gambling
occupied
three
days
of
wassail
and
jollity
after
which
the
visitors
returned
to
their
respective
towns
and
the
people
to
their
occupations
the
neighboring
villages
gave
similar
feasts
in
their
turn
they
were
occasions
of
much
evil
and
folly
my
time
flew
very
rapidly
and
pleasantly
away
for
two
or
three
years
until
like
most
children
i
began
to
sigh
for
deliverance
from
the
restraints
of
home
i
had
already
left
school
and
for
some
time
being
now
about
thirteen
years
of
age
had
been
employed
in
the
pleasure-grounds
of
blenheim
palace
this
however
was
too
tame
a
business
for
a
lad
of
my
spirits
i
had
heard
tales
of
the
sea
from
my
cousins
my
mother
had
filled
my
mind
with
the
exploits
of
my
grandfather
my
imagination
painted
a
life
on
the
great
deep
in
the
most
glowing
colors
my
mind
grew
uneasy
every
day
my
ordinary
pursuits
became
more
and
more
irksome
and
i
was
continually
talking
about
going
to
sea
indeed
i
had
made
myself
unhappy
by
being
so
discontented
little
do
lads
and
young
men
know
of
the
difference
between
the
comfort
of
a
parent’s
roof
and
the
indifference
unkindness
and
trouble
they
invariably
experience
who
go
out
into
the
world
until
they
have
made
the
experiment
they
paint
everything
in
bright
colors
they
fancy
the
future
to
be
all
sunshine
all
sweets
all
flowers
but
are
sure
to
be
wofully
disappointed
when
once
away
from
the
fireside
of
their
infancy
let
me
advise
young
people
if
they
wish
to
escape
hardships
to
be
contented
to
remain
quietly
at
home
abiding
the
openings
of
providence
obeying
the
wishes
of
their
parents
who
not
only
have
their
best
good
at
heart
but
however
they
may
think
to
the
contrary
actually
know
what
is
most
for
their
advantage
my
passion
for
a
seaman’s
life
was
not
a
little
increased
by
a
soldier
who
was
sergeant
to
a
company
in
lord
francis
spencer’s
regiment
of
cavalry
seated
by
my
father’s
hearth-side
this
old
soldier
who
had
once
been
a
sailor
would
beguile
many
an
evening
hour
with
his
endless
tale
while
i
sat
listening
in
enrapt
attention
my
mother
too
heedlessly
fanned
the
flame
by
her
descriptions
of
the
noble
appearance
of
the
ships
she
had
seen
when
at
brighton
besides
this
a
footman
at
blenheim
house
used
to
sing
a
song
called
the
poor
little
sailor
boy
which
although
somewhat
gloomy
in
its
descriptions
only
served
to
heighten
the
flame
of
desire
within
me
until
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
day
or
night
but
of
going
to
sea
finding
my
desires
so
strong
my
kind-hearted
mother
mentioned
them
to
lady
spencer
just
at
that
time
her
brother
lord
william
fitzroy
who
was
then
expecting
the
command
of
a
frigate
and
with
whom
my
departed
father
had
lived
as
valet
happened
to
visit
blenheim
previously
to
going
to
sea
anxious
to
serve
my
mother
lady
spencer
mentioned
me
to
lord
fitzroy
he
sent
for
me
trembling
in
every
joint
i
was
ushered
into
his
presence
he
inquired
if
i
should
like
to
go
to
sea
yes
my
lord
i
should
was
my
ready
answer
he
dismissed
me
after
some
further
questionings
but
was
heard
to
say
before
he
left
that
he
would
take
me
under
his
care
and
see
to
my
future
advancement
these
dazzling
prospects
not
only
well
nigh
turned
my
brain
but
decided
my
parents
to
send
me
to
sea
to
have
their
son
an
officer
in
the
navy
was
an
unlooked-for
honor
and
they
now
entered
into
my
plans
and
feelings
with
almost
as
much
ardor
as
myself
alas
we
were
all
doomed
to
learn
how
little
confidence
can
be
placed
in
the
promises
of
nobles
not
long
after
lord
fitzroy’s
departure
we
received
a
letter
stating
the
fact
of
his
appointment
to
his
majesty’s
frigate
macedonian
which
being
out
of
dock
was
rapidly
preparing
for
sea
this
intelligence
was
the
signal
for
bustle
excitement
preparation
and
i
know
not
what
friends
and
gossips
constantly
crowded
in
to
administer
their
gratuitous
advice
some
predicting
to
my
infinite
delight
that
certainly
so
smart
a
boy
would
make
a
great
man
others
wore
very
grave
countenances
and
gave
certain
expressive
shrugs
of
the
shoulders
while
they
told
of
flogging
through
the
fleet
or
of
being
seized
up
for
merely
a
look
or
a
word
in
short
but
for
a
strong
conviction
in
my
own
breast
that
this
was
all
said
for
effect
it
is
doubtful
whether
they
would
not
have
succeeded
in
deterring
me
from
my
purpose
at
last
after
much
ado
the
long-expected
day
arrived
when
i
was
to
bid
farewell
to
home
and
friends
to
venture
abroad
upon
an
unknown
future
it
would
only
vex
the
reader
by
its
commonplace
character
or
i
would
reveal
all
the
nice
little
acts
of
parental
brotherly
and
neighborly
affection
which
took
place
suffice
it
to
say
that
my
parting
was
very
much
the
same
as
that
of
all
other
boys
of
twelve
when
they
leave
home
for
the
first
time--a
mixture
of
hopes
and
fears
of
tears
and
smiles
of
sunshine
and
cloud
attended
by
my
mother
and
her
infant
daughter
on
the
12th
day
of
july
1810
i
turned
my
back
on
the
quiet
hamlet
of
bladen
henceforth
my
lot
was
to
be
cast
amid
noise
dissipation
storms
and
danger
this
however
disturbed
my
mind
but
little
brushing
away
a
tear
i
leaped
gaily
on
to
the
outside
of
the
coach
and
in
a
few
minutes
enveloped
in
a
cloud
of
dust
was
on
my
way
to
london
filled
with
the
one
absorbing
idea
i
am
going
to
sea
i
am
going
to
sea
should
the
reader
take
the
trouble
to
read
the
following
chapters
he
will
learn
the
mishaps
hardships
pleasures
and
successes
that
befell
me
there
and
though
my
narrative
may
not
be
filled
with
the
witching
tales
and
romantic
descriptions
that
abound
in
the
works
of
the
novelist
it
shall
at
least
commend
itself
to
his
notice
for
its
truthfulness
chapter
ii
before
we
sought
the
decks
of
the
macedonian
we
paid
a
short
visit
to
wanstead
where
we
met
with
very
pleasant
reception
very
hospitable
entertainment
very
affectionate
adieus
returning
to
london
we
hired
a
boat
and
sailed
down
the
thames
on
whose
bosom
reposed
the
commerce
of
the
world
to
gravesend
where
we
spent
the
night
the
next
morning
i
experienced
a
new
gratification
which
was
nothing
less
than
being
arrayed
in
a
complete
suit
of
sailor
apparel
a
tarpaulin
hat
round
blue
jacket
and
wide
pantaloons
never
did
young
knight
swell
with
loftier
emotion
when
donning
for
the
first
time
his
iron
dress
than
i
did
when
in
sea
dress
i
trod
the
streets
of
gravesend
this
had
always
been
my
highest
ambition
the
gaudily
dressed
soldier
never
had
charms
for
me
but
a
sailor
how
nice
he
looked
well
here
i
stood
at
last
in
the
often
coveted
dress
it
was
the
first
luxury
connected
with
my
life
at
sea
pity
that
each
successive
step
had
not
yielded
me
equal
delight
but
it
was
mine
to
learn
that
anticipation
and
reality
were
not
born
twins
that
in
fact
there
are
scarcely
any
two
existences
so
essentially
different
in
their
characteristics
that
i
should
not
lack
the
means
of
comfort
my
good
mother
purchased
me
a
chest
of
clothing
and
as
her
last
token
of
maternal
care
presented
me
with
a
bible
a
prayer
book
and
strangely
inconsistent
companions
a
pack
of
cards
thus
equipped
we
once
more
hired
a
boat
and
descended
the
river
two
miles
below
gravesend
where
lay
the
macedonian
in
graceful
majesty
on
the
sparkling
waters
the
first
guest
we
met
on
board
was
disappointment
from
the
promises
of
lord
fitzroy
we
very
strangely
supposed
that
he
felt
my
importance
nearly
as
much
as
did
my
mother
or
father
judge
then
how
we
felt
when
we
learned
that
no
one
knew
anything
in
particular
about
my
veritable
self
yet
as
his
lordship
was
absent
they
said
i
might
remain
on
board
until
his
return
this
was
rather
a
damper
on
my
spirits
but
flattering
myself
that
all
would
be
right
on
his
return
i
soon
rallied
again
and
aided
by
the
presence
of
my
mother
passed
a
very
agreeable
day
towards
night
my
mother
left
me
it
scarcely
need
be
said
she
wept
when
we
parted
what
mother
would
not
she
did
weep
she
strained
me
to
her
heart
and
impressed
affection’s
purest
kiss
upon
my
cheek
how
like
a
dream
that
moment
fled
now
she
held
me
in
her
arms
a
moment
after
she
was
seated
in
the
light
boat
and
gliding
along
the
turbid
thames
on
her
homeward
way
i
leaned
over
the
taffrail
and
gazed
on
the
departing
boat
and
when
it
disappeared
i
turned
away
and
wept
the
morning
after
my
arrival
i
was
put
into
a
mess
the
crew
of
a
man
of
war
is
divided
into
little
communities
of
about
eight
called
messes
these
eat
and
drink
together
and
are
as
it
were
so
many
families
the
mess
to
which
i
was
introduced
was
composed
of
your
genuine
weather-beaten
old
tars
but
for
one
of
its
members
it
would
have
suited
me
very
well
this
one
a
real
gruff
old
bull-dog
named
hudson
took
into
his
head
to
hate
me
at
first
sight
he
treated
me
with
so
much
abuse
and
unkindness
that
my
messmates
soon
advised
me
to
change
my
mess
a
privilege
which
is
wisely
allowed
and
which
tends
very
much
to
the
good
fellowship
of
a
ship’s
crew
for
if
there
are
disagreeable
men
among
them
they
can
in
this
way
be
got
rid
of
it
is
no
unfrequent
case
to
find
a
few
who
have
been
spurned
from
all
the
messes
in
the
ship
obliged
to
mess
by
themselves
this
unkindness
from
the
brutal
hudson
rather
chilled
my
enthusiasm
the
crew
too
by
some
means
had
an
impression
that
my
mother
had
brought
me
on
board
to
get
rid
of
me
and
therefore
bestowed
their
bitterest
curses
on
her
in
the
most
profuse
manner
imaginable
swearing
i
had
heard
before
but
never
such
as
i
heard
there
nor
was
this
all
in
performing
the
work
assigned
me
which
consisted
in
helping
the
seamen
take
in
provisions
powder
shot
etc
i
felt
the
insults
and
tyranny
of
the
midshipmen
these
little
minions
of
power
ordered
and
drove
me
round
like
a
dog
nor
did
i
and
the
other
boys
dare
interpose
a
word
they
were
officers
their
word
was
our
law
and
woe
betide
the
presumptuous
boy
that
dared
refuse
implicit
obedience
these
things
reminded
me
of
what
had
been
said
to
me
of
the
hardships
of
sea
life
in
a
man
of
war
i
began
to
wish
myself
back
in
my
father’s
house
at
bladen
this
however
was
impossible
and
to
add
to
my
discouragement
they
told
me
i
was
entered
on
the
ship’s
books
for
life
dreary
prospect
i
felt
more
than
half
disposed
as
i
went
to
my
tasks
to
use
the
language
of
the
irishman
as
sung
by
my
shipmates
tempted
and
beguiled
while
intoxicated
he
had
enlisted
for
a
soldier
but
found
the
sergeant
at
the
recruiting
office
and
the
sergeant
on
the
drill-field
very
different
personages
he
is
hence
made
to
say
it
was
early
next
morning
to
drill
i
was
sent
and
its
och
to
my
soul
i
began
to
lament
cannot
you
be
aisy
and
let
me
alone
don’t
you
see
i’ve
got
arms
legs
and
feet
of
my
own
but
although
somewhat
grieved
with
my
first
experience
of
sailor
life
i
secretly
struggled
against
my
feelings
and
with
the
most
philosophic
desperation
resolved
to
make
the
best
of
my
condition
we
were
kept
busily
at
work
every
day
until
the
ship’s
stores
were
all
on
board
and
our
frigate
was
ready
for
sea
then
two
hundred
more
men
draughted
from
receiving
ships
came
on
board
to
complete
the
number
of
our
crew
which
after
this
addition
numbered
full
three
hundred
men
the
jocularity
pleasantry
humor
and
good
feeling
that
now
prevailed
on
board
our
frigate
somewhat
softened
the
unpleasantness
of
my
lot
and
cultivated
a
feeling
of
reconciliation
to
my
circumstances
various
little
friendships
which
sprang
up
between
me
and
my
shipmates
threw
a
gleam
of
gladness
across
my
path
a
habit
of
attention
respect
and
obedience
in
a
short
time
secured
me
universal
good
will
i
began
to
be
tolerably
satisfied
many
boys
complain
of
ill
usage
at
sea
i
know
they
are
subjected
to
it
in
many
instances
yet
in
most
cases
they
owe
it
to
their
own
boldness
a
boy
on
shipboard
who
is
habitually
saucy
will
be
kicked
and
cuffed
by
all
with
whom
he
has
to
do
he
will
be
made
miserable
the
reason
is
i
imagine
that
sailors
being
treated
as
inferiors
themselves
love
to
find
opportunity
to
act
the
superior
over
some
one
they
do
this
over
the
boys
and
if
they
find
a
saucy
insolent
one
they
show
him
no
mercy
permit
me
then
to
advise
boys
who
go
to
sea
to
be
civil
and
obliging
to
all
they
will
be
amply
repaid
for
the
effort
it
may
cost
them
to
make
the
trial
especially
if
they
gain
the
reputation
as
i
did
of
being
among
the
best
boys
in
the
ship
a
vessel
of
war
contains
a
little
community
of
human
beings
isolated
for
the
time
being
from
the
rest
of
mankind
this
community
is
governed
by
laws
peculiar
to
itself
it
is
arranged
and
divided
in
a
manner
suitable
to
its
circumstances
hence
when
its
members
first
come
together
each
one
is
assigned
his
respective
station
and
duty
for
every
task
from
getting
up
the
anchor
to
unbending
the
sails
aloft
and
below
at
the
mess-tub
or
in
the
hammock
each
task
has
its
man
and
each
man
his
place
a
ship
contains
a
set
of
human
machinery
in
which
every
man
is
a
wheel
a
band
or
a
crank
all
moving
with
wonderful
regularity
and
precision
to
the
will
of
its
machinist--the
all-powerful
captain
the
men
are
distributed
in
all
parts
of
the
vessel
those
in
the
tops
are
called
fore-top-men
main-top-men
and
mizzen-top-men
with
two
captains
to
each
top
one
for
each
watch
these
top-men
have
to
loose
take
in
reef
and
furl
the
sails
aloft
such
as
the
top-gallant
sails
top-sails
top-gallant
royal
and
top-sail
studding-sails
others
are
called
forecastle
men
waisters
and
the
after-guard
these
have
to
loose
tend
and
furl
the
courses
that
is
the
fore-sail
the
main-sail
and
lower
studding-sails
they
also
have
to
set
the
jib
flying-jib
and
spanker
the
after-guard
have
a
special
charge
to
coil
up
all
ropes
in
the
after
part
of
the
ship
others
are
called
scavengers
these
as
their
not
very
attractive
name
imports
have
to
sweep
and
pick
up
the
dirt
that
may
chance
to
gather
through
the
day
and
throw
it
overboard
then
come
the
boys
who
are
mostly
employed
as
servants
to
the
officers
our
captain
had
a
steward
and
a
boy
these
acted
as
his
domestic
servants
in
his
large
and
stately
cabin
which
to
meet
the
ideas
of
landsmen
may
be
called
his
house
the
lieutenants
purser
surgeon
and
sailing-master
had
each
a
boy
they
together
with
the
two
lieutenants
of
marines
who
were
waited
upon
by
two
marines
form
what
is
called
the
ward-room
officers
the
ward-room
is
a
large
cabin
i
mean
large
for
a
ship
of
course
below
the
captain’s
where
they
all
mess
together
aft
of
this
cabin
is
a
smaller
one
which
serves
as
a
species
of
store-room
besides
these
accommodations
every
ward-room
officer
has
his
state-room
containing
his
cot
wash-stand
writing-desk
clothes
etc
the
gunner
boatswain
and
some
others
are
also
allowed
a
boy
and
a
man
and
boy
are
appointed
to
be
the
servants
of
a
certain
number
of
midshipmen
another
arrangement
is
that
of
forming
the
ship’s
company

are
liable
to
be
called
out
to
take
in
sail
some
of
the
last
mentioned
are
called
idlers
all
others
are
in
watches
called
the
larboard
and
starboard
watches
stations
are
also
assigned
at
the
guns
to
the
whole
crew
when
at
sea
the
drummer
beats
to
quarters
every
night
this
beat
by
which
the
men
are
summoned
to
quarters
is
a
regular
tune
i
have
often
heard
the
words
sung
which
belong
to
it
this
is
the
chorus
hearts
of
oak
are
our
ships
jolly
tars
are
our
men
we
always
are
ready
steady

steady
to

and
to
conquer
again
and
again
at
the
roll
of
this
evening
drum
all
hands
hurry
to
the
guns
eight
men
and
a
boy
are
stationed
at
each
gun
one
of
whom
is
captain
of
the
gun
another
sponges
and
loads
it
the
rest
take
hold
of
the
side
tackle-falls
to
run
the
gun
in
and
out
while
the
boy
is
employed
in
handing
the
cartridges
for
which
he
is
honored
with
the
singularly
euphonious
cognomen
of
powder-monkey
besides
these
arrangements
among
the
men
there
are
from
thirty
to
forty
marines
to
be
disposed
of

at
the
galley
during
the
time
of
cooking
they
are
also
stationed
at
the
large
guns
at
night
as
far
as
their
numbers
run
when
a

is
in
action
and

arms
can
be
brought
to
bear
on
the

they
are
stationed
on
the

are
also
expected
to
assist
in
boarding
in
conjunction
with
several
seamen
from
each
gun
who
are
armed
with
pistols
and
pikes
and
called
boarders
the
great
disparity
of
numbers
between
the
crew
of
a
merchant
ship
and
that
of
a
man
of
war
occasions
a
difference
in
their
internal
arrangements
and
mode
of
life
scarcely
conceivable
by
those
who
have
not
seen
both
this
is
seen
throughout
from
the
act
of
rousing
the
hands
in
the
morning
to
that
of
taking
in
sail
in
the
merchantman
the
watch
below
is
called
up
by
a
few
strokes
of
the
handspike
on
the
forecastle
in
the
man
of
war
by
the
boatswain
and
his
mates
the
boatswain
is
a
petty
officer
of
considerable
importance
in
his
way
he
and
his
mates
carry
a
small
silver
whistle
or
pipe
suspended
from
the
neck
by
a
small
cord
he
receives
word
from
the
officer
of
the
watch
to
call
the
hands
up
you
immediately
hear
a
sharp
shrill
whistle
this
is
succeeded
by
another
and
another
from
his
mates
then
follows
his
hoarse
rough
cry
of
all
hands
ahoy
which
is
forthwith
repeated
by
his
mates
scarcely
has
this
sound
died
upon
the
ear
before
the
cry
of
up
all
hammocks
ahoy
succeeds
it
to
be
repeated
in
like
manner
as
the
first
tones
of
the
whistle
penetrate
between
decks
signs
of
life
make
their
appearance
rough
uncouth
forms
are
seen
tumbling
out
of
their
hammocks
on
all
sides
and
before
its
last
sounds
have
died
upon
the
air
the
whole
company
of
sleepers
are
hurriedly
preparing
for
the
duties
of
the
day
no
delay
is
permitted
for
as
soon
as
the
before-mentioned
officers
have
uttered
their
imperative
commands
they
run
below
each
armed
with
a
rope’s
end
with
which
they
belabor
the
shoulders
of
any
luckless
wight
upon
whose
eyes
sleep
yet
hangs
heavily
or
whose
slow-moving
limbs
show
him
to
be
but
half
awake
with
a
rapidity
which
would
surprise
a
landsman
the
crew
dress
themselves
lash
their
hammocks
and
carry
them
on
deck
where
they
are
stowed
for
the
day
there
is
system
even
in
this
arrangement
every
hammock
has
its
appropriate
place
below
the
beams
are
all
marked
each
hammock
is
marked
with
a
corresponding
number
and
in
the
darkest
night
a
sailor
will
go
unhesitatingly
to
his
own
hammock
they
are
also
kept
exceeding
clean
every
man
is
provided
with
two
so
that
while
he
is
scrubbing
and
cleaning
one
he
may
have
another
to
use
nothing
but
such
precautions
could
enable
so
many
men
to
live
in
so
small
a
space
a
similar
rapidity
attends
the
performance
of
every
duty
the
word
of
command
is
given
in
the
same
manner
and
its
prompt
obedience
enforced
by
the
same
unceremonious
rope’s-end
to
skulk
is
therefore
next
to
impossible
the
least
tardiness
is
rebuked
by
the
cry
of
hurrah
my
hearty
bear
a
hand
heave
along
heave
along
this
system
of
driving
is
far
from
being
agreeable
it
perpetually
reminds
you
of
your
want
of
liberty
it
makes
you
feel
sometimes
as
if
the
hardest
crust
the
most
ragged
garments
with
the
freedom
of
your
own
native
hills
would
be
preferable
to
john
bull’s
beef
and
duff
joined
as
it
is
with
the
rope’s-end
of
the
driving
boatswain
we
had
one
poor
fellow
an
irishman
named
billy
garvy
who
felt
very
uneasy
and
unhappy
he
was
the
victim
of
that
mortifying
system
of
impressment
prevalent
in
great
britain
in
time
of
war
he
came
on
board
perfectly
unacquainted
with
the
mysteries
of
sea
life
one
of
his
first
inquiries
was
where
he
should
find
his
bed
supposing
they
slept
on
shipboard
on
beds
the
same
as
on
shore
his
messmates
with
true
sailor
roguishness
sent
him
to
the
boatswain
and
where
shall
i
find
a
bed
sir
asked
he
of
this
rugged
son
of
the
ocean
the
boatswain
looked
at
him
very
contemptuously
for
a
moment
then
rolling
his
lump
of
tobacco
into
another
apartment
of
his
ample
mouth
replied
have
you
got
a
knife
yes
sir
well
stick
it
into
the
softest
plank
in
the
ship
and
take
that
for
a
bed
poor
fellow
what
was
sport
for
others
was
pain
to
him
he
had
been
used
to
kind
treatment
at
home
after
he
had
received
his
hammock
when
turning
out
in
the
morning
with
the
boatswain’s
mates
at
his
heels
he
used
to
exclaim
when
i
was
at
home
i
would
walk
in
my
father’s
garden
in
the
morning
until
the
maid
would
come
and
say
‘william
will
you
come
to
your
ta
or
your
coffee
ta
or
your
chocolarata?’
but
oh
the
case
is
altered
now
it’s
nothing
but
bear
a
hand
lash
and
carry
oh
dear
i
confess
that
billy
garvy
was
not
the
only
one
who
contrasted
the
present
with
the
past
or
who
found
the
balance
to
be
greatly
in
favor
of
the
former
i
often
looked
back
to
the
village
of
bladen
and
thought
how
preferable
would
be
the
bright
hearth-side
and
pleasant
voices
of
that
quiet
home
to
the
profane
rough
uncomfortable
life
we
led
on
shipboard
as
these
reflections
were
anything
but
pleasurable
i
banished
them
as
quickly
as
possible
with
a
determination
to
be
as
happy
as
i
could
in
my
station
of
servant
to
the
surgeon
of
his
britannic
majesty’s
frigate
macedonian
a
resolution
which
i
commend
to
all
lads
who
like
me
are
foolish
enough
to
quit
the
quiet
scenes
of
a
native
village
for
the
noisy
profane
atmosphere
of
a
man
of
war
as
our
fare
was
novel
and
so
different
from
shore
living
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
get
fully
reconciled
to
it
it
was
composed
of
hard
sea
biscuit
fresh
beef
while
in
port
but
salt
pork
and
salt
beef
at
sea
pea
soup
and
burgoo
burgoo
or
as
it
was
sportively
called
skillagallee
was
oatmeal
boiled
in
water
to
the
consistency
of
hasty
pudding
sometimes
we
had
cocoa
instead
of
burgoo
once
a
week
we
had
flour
and
raisins
served
out
with
which
we
made
duff
or
pudding
to
prepare
these
articles
each
mess
had
its
cook
who
drew
the
provisions
made
the
duff
washed
the
mess
kids
etc
he
also
drew
the
grog
for
the
mess
which
consisted
of
a
gill
of
rum
mixed
with
two
gills
of
water
for
each
man
this
was
served
out
at
noon
every
day
at
four
o’clock
p
m
each
man
received
half
a
pint
of
wine
the
boys
only
drew
half
this
quantity
but
were
allowed
pay
for
the
remainder
a
regulation
which
could
have
been
profitably
applied
to
the
whole
supply
of
grog
and
wine
for
both
boys
and
men
but
those
were
not
days
in
which
temperance
triumphed
as
she
does
now
though
i
believe
the
british
navy
has
not
yet
ceased
to
dispense
the
drink
that’s
in
the
drunkard’s
bowl
to
her
seamen
shortly
after
our
captain
came
on
board
his
servant
died
somewhat
suddenly
so
that
i
had
an
early
opportunity
of
seeing
how
sailors
are
disposed
of
in
this
sad
hour
the
corpse
was
laid
out
on
the
grating
covered
with
a
flag
as
we
were
yet
in
the
river
the
body
was
taken
on
shore
and
buried
without
the
beautiful
burial-service
of
the
church
of
england
being
read
at
his
grave--a
ceremony
which
is
not
omitted
at
the
interment
of
the
veriest
pauper
in
that
country
i
have
purposely
dwelt
on
these
particulars
that
the
reader
may
feel
himself
initiated
at
once
into
the
secrets
of
man-of-war
usages
he
has
doubtless
seen
ships
of
war
with
their
trim
rigging
and
frowning
ports
and
his
heart
has
swelled
with
pride
as
he
has
gazed
upon
these
floating
cities--the
representatives
of
his
nation’s
character
in
foreign
countries
to
their
internal
arrangements
however
he
has
been
a
stranger
i
have
endeavored
to
introduce
him
into
the
interior
a
desire
to
make
him
feel
at
home
there
is
my
apology
for
dwelling
so
long
on
these
descriptions
after
various
delays
we
were
at
last
ready
for
sea
and
under
sailing
orders
the
tide
and
wind
were
both
propitious
then
came
the
long-expected
cry
of
the
boatswain
all
hands
up
anchor
ahoy
the
crew
manned
the
capstan
in
a
trice
and
running
round
to
the
tune
of
a
lively
air
played
by
the
fifer
the
huge
anchor
rapidly
left
the
mud
of
the
thames
and
hung
at
the
bows
of
our
taut
frigate
then
came
the
cry
of
all
hands
make
sail
ahoy
as
if
by
magic
she
was
immediately
covered
with
canvas
the
favoring
breeze
at
once
filled
our
sails
and
the
form
that
had
lain
for
weeks
inert
and
motionless
on
the
waters
now
bounded
along
the
waves
like
a
thing
of
life
rapidly
we
ran
down
the
channel
and
before
we
had
well
got
under
weigh
came
to
an
anchor
again
at
spithead
under
shelter
of
the
garden
of
england--the
isle
of
wight
short
as
was
the
period
between
weighing
anchor
off
gravesend
and
our
arrival
at
spithead
it
gave
opportunity
for
one
of
those
occurrences
which
are
a
disgrace
to
the
naval
service
of
any
nation
and
a
degradation
to
our
common
humanity
which
the
public
opinion
of
the
civilized
world
should
frown
out
of
existence
i
allude
to
the
brutal
practice
of
flogging
a
poor
fellow
had
fallen
into
the
very
sailorlike
offence
of
getting
drunk
for
this
the
captain
sentenced
him
to
the
punishment
of
four
dozen
lashes
he
was
first
placed
in
irons
all
night
the
irons
used
for
this
purpose
were
shackles
fitting
round
the
ankles
through
the
ends
of
which
was
passed
an
iron
bar
some
ten
or
twelve
feet
in
length
it
was
thus
long
because
it
was
no
unfrequent
case
for
half
a
dozen
men
to
be
ironed
at
once
a
padlock
at
the
end
of
the
bar
held
the
prisoner
securely
thus
placed
in
duress
vile
he
was
guarded
by
a
marine
until
the
captain
bade
the
first
lieutenant
prepare
the
hands
to
witness
the
punishment
upon
this
the
lieutenant
transmitted
the
order
to
the
master
at
arms
he
then
ordered
the
grating
or
hatch
full
of
square
holes
to
be
rigged
it
was
placed
accordingly
between
the
main
and
spar
decks
not
far
from
the
mainmast
while
these
preparations
were
going
on
the
officers
were
dressing
themselves
in
full
uniform
and
arming
themselves
with
their
dirks
the
prisoner’s
messmates
carried
him
his
best
clothes
to
make
him
appear
in
as
decent
a
manner
as
possible
this
is
always
done
in
the
hope
of
moving
the
feelings
of
the
captain
favorably
towards
the
prisoner
this
done
the
hoarse
dreaded
cry
of
all
hands
ahoy
to
witness
punishment
from
the
lips
of
the
boatswain
peals
along
the
ship
as
mournfully
as
the
notes
of
a
funeral
knell
at
this
signal
the
officers
muster
on
the
spar
deck
the
men
on
the
main
deck
next
came
the
prisoner
guarded
by
a
marine
on
one
side
and
the
master
at
arms
on
the
other
he
was
marched
up
to
the
grating
his
back
was
made
bare
and
his
shirt
laid
loosely
upon
his
back
the
two
quartermasters
proceeded
to
seize
him
up
that
is
they
tied
his
hands
and
feet
with
spun-yarns
called
the
seizings
to
the
grating
the
boatswain’s
mates
whose
office
it
is
to
flog
on
board
a
man
of
war
stood
ready
with
their
dreadful
weapon
of
punishment
the
cat-o’-nine-tails
this
instrument
of
torture
was
composed
of
nine
cords
a
quarter
of
an
inch
round
and
about
two
feet
long
the
ends
whipt
with
fine
twine
to
these
cords
was
affixed
a
stock
two
feet
in
length
covered
with
red
baize
the
reader
may
be
sure
that
it
is
a
most
formidable
instrument
in
the
hands
of
a
strong
skilful
man
indeed
any
man
who
should
whip
his
horse
with
it
would
commit
an
outrage
on
humanity
which
the
moral
feeling
of
any
community
would
not
tolerate
he
would
be
prosecuted
for
cruelty
yet
it
is
used
to
whip
men
on
board
ships
of
war
the
boatswain’s
mate
is
ready
with
coat
off
and
whip
in
hand
the
captain
gives
the
word
carefully
spreading
the
cords
with
the
fingers
of
his
left
hand
the
executioner
throws
the
cat
over
his
right
shoulder
it
is
brought
down
upon
the
now
uncovered
herculean
shoulders
of
the
man
his
flesh
creeps--it
reddens
as
if
blushing
at
the
indignity
the
sufferer
groans
lash
follows
lash
until
the
first
mate
wearied
with
the
cruel
employment
gives
place
to
a
second
now
two
dozen
of
these
dreadful
lashes
have
been
inflicted
the
lacerated
back
looks
inhuman
it
resembles
roasted
meat
burnt
nearly
black
before
a
scorching
fire
yet
still
the
lashes
fall
the
captain
continues
merciless
vain
are
the
cries
and
prayers
of
the
wretched
man
i
would
not
forgive
the
saviour
was
the
blasphemous
reply
of
one
of
these
naval
demi-gods
or
rather
demi-fiends
to
a
plea
for
mercy
the
executioners
keep
on
four
dozen
strokes
have
cut
up
his
flesh
and
robbed
him
of
all
self-respect
there
he
hangs
a
pitied
self-despised
groaning
bleeding
wretch
and
now
the
captain
cries
forbear
his
shirt
is
thrown
over
his
shoulders
the
seizings
are
loosed
he
is
led
away
staining
his
path
with
red
drops
of
blood
and
the
hands
piped
down
by
the
boatswain
sullenly
return
to
their
duties
such
was
the
scene
witnessed
on
board
the
macedonian
on
the
passage
from
london
to
spithead
such
substantially
is
every
punishment
scene
at
sea
only
carried
sometimes
to
a
greater
length
of
severity
sad
and
sorrowful
were
my
feelings
on
witnessing
it
thoughts
of
the
friendly
warnings
of
my
old
acquaintance
filled
my
mind
and
i
inwardly
wished
myself
once
more
under
the
friendly
roof
of
my
father
at
bladen
vain
wish
i
should
have
believed
the
warning
voice
when
it
was
given
believe
me
young
man
you
will
often
breathe
that
wish
if
ever
you
wander
from
a
father’s
house
flogging
in
the
navy
is
more
severe
than
in
the
army
though
it
is
too
bad
to
be
tolerated
there
or
indeed
anywhere
other
modes
of
punishment
might
be
successfully
substituted
which
would
deter
from
misconduct
without
destroying
the
self-respect
of
the
man
i
hope
the
day
will
come
when
a
captain
will
no
more
be
allowed
to
use
the
cat
than
he
is
now
to
use
poison
it
should
be
an
interdicted
weapon
though
i
have
spoken
severely
of
the
officers
of
the
navy
let
it
not
be
thought
that
the
whole
class
of
naval
officers
are
lost
to
the
finer
feelings
of
humanity
there
are
many
humane
considerate
men
among
them
who
deserve
our
highest
respect
this
was
the
case
with
the
first
lieutenant
of
the
macedonian
mr
scott
he
abhorred
flogging
once
when
a
poor
marine
was
under
sentence
he
plead
hard
and
successfully
with
the
captain
for
his
respite
this
was
a
great
victory
for
the
captain
had
a
profound
hatred
of
marines
the
poor
soldier
was
extremely
grateful
for
his
intercession
and
would
do
anything
for
him
to
show
his
sense
of
the
obligation
indeed
the
sailors
in
their
odd
way
showed
their
preference
for
him
by
describing
him
as
a
man
who
had
a
soul
to
be
saved
and
who
ought
to
go
to
heaven
while
of
the
captain
they
whispered
that
if
he
did
not
go
to
perdition
the
devil
would
be
cheated
of
his
due
these
are
in
a
manner
proverbial
expressions
of
like
and
dislike
on
board
a
british
man
of
war
one
of
the
effects
of
this
exhibition
of
cruelty
was
seen
during
the
short
time
we
lay
at
spithead
the
two
boys
who
were
servants
to
the
first
and
second
lieutenants
conceiving
a
special
dislike
to
the
idea
of
being
flogged
took
it
into
their
heads
to
run
away
being
sent
on
shore
they
shaped
their
course
for
the
country
it
was
well
for
them
that
they
were
not
re-taken
our
frigate
had
orders
to
convey
between
two
and
three
hundred
troops
from
portsmouth
to
lisbon
to
assist
the
portuguese
against
the
french
the
soldiers
were
stowed
on
the
main
decks
with
very
few
conveniences
for
the
voyage
their
officers
messed
and
berthed
in
the
ward-room
having
taken
them
on
board
we
again
weighed
anchor
and
were
soon
careering
before
the
breeze
on
our
way
to
lisbon
as
usual
we
who
were
landsmen
had
our
share
of
that
merciless
nondescript
hateful
stultifying
disease
yclept
sea-sickness
as
usual
we
wished
the
foolish
wish
that
we
had
never
come
to
sea
as
usual
we
got
over
it
and
laughed
at
ourselves
for
our
sea-sick
follies
our
good
ship
paid
little
attention
however
to
our
feelings
she
kept
along
on
her
bounding
way
and
after
a
week
at
sea
we
were
greeted
with
the
pleasant
cry
of
land
ho
from
the
mast-head
as
it
was
now
near
night
we
lay
off
and
on
until
morning
at
day-break
we
fired
a
gun
for
a
pilot
the
wind
being
nearly
dead
ahead
we
had
to
beat
about
nearly
all
day
towards
night
it
became
fair
and
we
ascended
the
tagus
this
river
is
about
nine
miles
wide
at
its
mouth
and
is
four
hundred
and
fifty
miles
in
length
it
has
a
very
rapid
current
with
steep
fertile
banks
aided
by
a
fine
breeze
we
ascended
it
in
splendid
style
passed
a
half-moon
battery
then
shot
past
belem
castle
into
the
port
of
lisbon
about
ten
miles
from
its
mouth
here
we
found
a
spacious
harbor
filled
with
shipping
besides
numerous
merchantmen
there
were
two
ships
of
a
hundred
guns
several
seventy-fours
frigates
and
sloops
of
war
with
a
large
number
of
transports
all
designed
for
the
defence
of
lisbon
against
the
french
lisbon
has
a
fine
appearance
from
the
harbor
a
stranger
after
a
long
sea-voyage
while
standing
on
the
deck
of
his
vessel
and
gazing
on
its
battlements
and
towers
might
fancy
it
to
be
a
terrestrial
paradise
but
on
landing
his
admiration
would
certainly
sink
below
zero
as
he
plodded
his
way
beset
by
saucy
beggars
at
almost
every
step
through
its
narrow
filthy
streets
such
at
least
was
my
impression
as
i
perambulated
the
city
among
other
things
i
noticed
a
great
variety
of
churches
and
convents
which
furnished
swarms
of
plump
good-natured
friars
under
whose
spiritual
domination
the
good
people
of
lisbon
were
content
to
rest
i
also
counted
thirteen
large
squares
one
of
them
contained
a
huge
black
horse
standing
in
its
centre
with
the
figure
of
a
man
upon
his
back
both
much
larger
than
life
what
this
monument
represented
i
did
not
learn
that
square
is
denominated
black
horse
square
on
the
day
after
our
arrival
the
macedonian
was
the
scene
of
considerable
bustle
the
troops
who
seemed
to
forget
their
proximity
to
a
field
of
carnage
in
the
delight
they
felt
at
escaping
from
the
confinement
on
shipboard
were
landed
several
boats’
crews
were
also
sent
up
the
river
to
assist
in
the
defence
of
the
place
while
we
lay
here
our
ship
was
well
supplied
with
fruits
from
the
shore
large
bunches
of
delicious
grapes
abundance
of
sweet
oranges
water-melons
chestnuts
and
also
a
bountiful
supply
of
gigantic
onions
of
peculiar
flavor
enabled
our
crew
to
gratify
their
palates
in
true
english
style
poor
fellows
they
feasted
laughed
and
joked
as
if
the
future
had
nothing
to
develop
but
fairy
scenes
of
unmixed
delight
little
thought
indeed
does
your
true
tar
take
of
the
morrow
amid
these
feastings
however
there
rose
something
to
trouble
macbeth
in
the
shape
of
an
order
from
the
admiral
to
prepare
for
a
cruise
this
was
peremptory;--for
a
cruise
therefore
we
prepared
our
boats’
crews
came
on
board
the
officers
stored
their
larder
with
the
means
of
gustatory
gratifications
and
we
stood
out
to
sea
again
the
port
of
corunna
in
spain
was
the
next
place
at
which
we
anchored
while
lying
in
this
spacious
and
safe
harbor
our
little
world
was
thrown
into
temporary
confusion
by
the
loss
of
the
ward-room
steward
mr
sanders
this
man
could
speak
in
the
spanish
tongue
he
had
accumulated
a
considerable
sum
of
money
by
long
service
prize
money
and
an
economy
little
known
among
sailors
for
some
cause
or
other
he
had
become
dissatisfied
so
one
day
he
engaged
a
spaniard
to
run
his
boat
under
the
stern
of
our
frigate
dropping
from
one
of
the
stern
ports
into
the
boat
unperceived
by
the
officers
the
wily
spaniards
covered
him
with
their
loose
garments
and
sails
and
then
conveyed
him
to
the
shore
this
was
running
a
great
risk
for
had
he
been
detected
in
the
act
or
taken
afterwards
he
would
have
felt
the
cruel
strokes
of
the
lash
fortunately
for
himself
he
escaped
without
detection
from
corunna
we
returned
to
lisbon
where
at
the
cheerful
cry
of
all
hands
bring
the
ship
to
an
anchor
ahoy
we
once
more
placed
our
frigate
taut
and
trim
under
the
battlements
of
the
city
as
servant
to
the
surgeon
it
was
one
part
of
my
duty
to
perform
the
task
of
carrying
his
clothes
to
be
washed
as
great
attention
to
cleanliness
in
frequently
changing
their
linen
is
observed
among
naval
officers
a
good
washerwoman
is
considered
quite
a
desideratum
in
attending
to
this
matter
for
my
master
i
had
frequent
opportunities
to
go
on
shore
this
gave
me
some
means
of
observation
on
one
of
my
visits
to
our
pretty
laundress
i
saw
several
portuguese
running
along
gesticulating
and
talking
with
great
earnestness
being
ignorant
of
their
language
my
washerwoman
who
spoke
good
english
told
me
that
a
man
had
been
stabbed
in
consequence
of
some
ground
for
jealousy
afforded
by
the
conduct
of
the
deceased
hastening
to
the
spot
i
saw
the
wounded
man
stretched
out
on
a
bed
with
two
gaping
wounds
in
his
side
the
long
knife
the
instrument
of
the
deed
lying
by
his
side
the
poor
sufferer
soon
died
what
was
done
to
the
murderer
i
could
not
discover
though
very
passionate
and
addicted
to
the
use
of
the
knife
for
the
purpose
of
taking
summary
vengeance
the
portuguese
are
nevertheless
arrant
cowards
indeed
it
is
a
question
by
no
means
settled
whether
all
classes
of
men
in
any
country
who
fly
to
cold
steel
or
to
fire-arms
in
every
petty
quarrel
are
not
cowards
at
heart
we
had
an
evidence
of
portuguese
cowardice
in
an
affray
which
occurred
between
some
of
the
citizens
of
lisbon
and
a
party
of
our
marines
six
of
the
latter
ignorant
of
the
palace
or
municipal
regulations
wandered
into
the
queen’s
gardens
some
twenty
of
the
portuguese
on
witnessing
this
bold
intrusion
on
the
privacy
of
the
queen
rushed
upon
them
with
long
knives
the
marines
though
so
inferior
in
number
faced
about
with
their
bayonets
and
after
much
cursing
and
chattering
their
enemies
considering
perhaps
that
the
better
part
of
valor
is
discretion
took
to
their
heels
leaving
the
six
marines
masters
of
a
bloodless
field
these
recontres
were
quite
common
between
them
and
our
men
the
result
though
sometimes
more
serious
was
uniformly
the
same
as
an
illustration
of
the
manners
of
this
people
i
cannot
forbear
the
insertion
of
another
fact
i
was
one
day
walking
leisurely
along
the
streets
quite
at
my
ease
when
the
gathering
of
a
noisy
multitude
arrested
my
attention
looking
up
i
was
shocked
at
seeing
a
human
head
with
a
pair
of
hands
beneath
it
nailed
to
a
pole
they
had
just
been
taken
from
the
body
of
a
barber
who
when
in
the
act
of
shaving
a
gentleman
was
seized
with
a
sudden
desire
to
possess
a
beautiful
watch
which
glittered
in
his
pocket
to
gain
this
brilliant
bauble
the
wretched
man
cut
his
victim’s
throat
he
was
arrested
his
hands
were
cut
off
then
his
head
and
both
were
fastened
to
the
pole
as
i
have
described
them
upon
inquiry
i
ascertained
that
this
was
the
ordinary
method
of
punishing
murder
in
portugal
a
striking
evidence
that
civilization
had
not
fully
completed
its
great
work
among
them
civilization
humanizes
the
feelings
of
society
throwing
a
veil
of
refinement
and
mercy
over
even
the
sterner
acts
of
justice
at
any
rate
it
never
tolerates
such
barbarism
as
i
saw
at
lisbon
while
in
port
we
experienced
a
change
of
officers
by
no
means
agreeable
to
the
crew
mr
scott
our
first
lieutenant
an
amiable
man
decidedly
hostile
to
the
practice
of
flogging
left
us
for
what
cause
we
could
not
ascertain
his
successor
mr
hope
though
bearing
a
very
pleasant
name
was
an
entirely
different
person
in
manners
and
conduct
from
his
predecessor
he
was
harsh
severe
and
fond
of
seeing
the
men
flogged
of
course
floggings
became
more
frequent
than
before
for
although
a
lieutenant
cannot
flog
upon
his
own
authority
yet
such
is
the
influence
he
exerts
over
a
captain
that
he
has
the
utmost
opportunity
to
gratify
a
thirst
for
punishment
it
may
appear
strange
to
the
reader
that
any
gentleman--and
all
officers
of
the
navy
consider
themselves
gentlemen_--should
possess
such
a
thirst
yet
such
was
the
case
with
mr
hope
nor
was
his
a
solitary
example
many
a
man
who
on
shore
in
presence
of
ladies
of
fashion
appeared
too
gentle
to
harm
an
enemy
too
kind
to
injure
an
insect
was
strangely
metamorphosed
into
a
genuine
unprincipled
tyrant
upon
assuming
command
in
a
man
of
war
we
had
already
witnessed
a
number
of
punishments
especially
at
sea
in
port
the
officers
were
more
condescending
lest
their
men
should
desert
but
at
sea
when
this
was
impossible
they
flogged
without
mercy
cases
of
offence
which
occurred
while
in
the
harbor
were
looked
up
sometimes
a
half
dozen
were
flogged
at
once
every
man
trembled
lest
he
should
be
a
victim
the
ship’s
crew
were
made
wretched
a
sword
seemed
impending
over
every
head
who
in
such
a
case
could
be
happy
not
even
a
sailor
with
all
his
habitual
thoughtlessness
yet
it
is
said
we
must
flog
to
maintain
discipline
among
sailors
pshaw
flogging
may
be
needful
to
awe
a
slave
writhing
under
a
sense
of
unmerited
wrong
but
never
should
a
lash
fall
on
a
freeman’s
back
especially
if
he
holds
the
safety
and
honor
of
his
country
in
his
keeping
poor
old
bob
hammond
never
was
man
more
reckless
than
this
honest-hearted
irishman
never
was
sailor
more
courageous
under
punishment
for
being
drunk
he
received
four
dozen
lashes
he
bore
the
infliction
with
profound
silence
uttering
neither
groan
nor
sigh
neither
casting
one
imploring
look
at
his
tormentors
on
being
taken
down
he
applied
himself
most
lustily
to
his
bottle
and
before
night
was
drunk
again
rushing
to
the
quarter
deck
with
a
madness
peculiar
to
a
phrensied
drunkard
he
ran
up
against
the
captain
with
such
force
that
he
nearly
knocked
him
down
with
a
boldness
that
seemed
to
strike
the
great
man
dumb
bob
hiccupped
and
said
halloo
billy
my
boy
is
that
you
you
are
young
and
foolish
just
fit
for
the
launch
you
are
like
a
young
lion--all
your
sorrows
are
to
come
the
captain
was
excessively
proud
even
his
officers
scarcely
dared
walk
the
quarter
deck
on
the
same
side
with
him
he
never
allowed
himself
to
be
addressed
but
by
his
title
of
my
lord
should
a
sailor
through
design
or
forgetfulness
reply
to
a
command
yes
sir
the
lordly
man
would
look
at
him
with
a
glance
full
of
dignity
and
sternly
reply
what
sir
this
of
course
would
put
the
offender
in
mind
to
correct
himself
by
saying
yes
my
lord
judge
then
of
his
surprise
indignation
nay
of
his
lordly
horror
when
poor
old
drunken
bob
hammond
called
him
billy
my
boy
doubtless
it
stirred
up
his
nobility
within
him
for
with
a
voice
of
thunder
he
exclaimed
put
this
man
in
irons
it
was
done
the
next
morning
his
back
yet
sore
poor
bob
received
five
dozen
more
strokes
of
the
hated
cat-o’-nine-tails
most
heroically
was
it
borne
no
sound
escaped
him
the
most
profound
silence
was
observed
by
all
broken
only
by
the
dead
sound
of
the
whip
as
it
fell
every
few
moments
on
the
wounded
back
the
scene
was
sickening
in
the
extreme
let
me
throw
a
veil
over
its
details
simply
remarking
that
it
is
questionable
which
of
the
two
appears
to
the
best
advantage
poor
drunken
bob
suffering
degrading
torture
with
heroic
firmness
or
my
lord
fitzroy
gloating
on
the
scene
with
the
appetite
of
a
vulture
let
the
reader
decide
for
himself
these
statements
may
at
first
sight
appear
incredible
it
may
be
asked
how
a
man
could
endure
whippings
which
would
destroy
an
ox
or
a
horse
this
is
a
very
natural
question
and
but
for
the
consciousness
i
feel
of
being
supported
in
my
statements
by
the
universal
testimony
of
old
men-of-war’s-men
i
should
hesitate
to
publish
them
the
worst
species
of
this
odious
torture
however
remains
to
be
described--flogging
through
the
fleet
this
punishment
is
never
inflicted
without
due
trial
and
sentence
by
a
court-martial
for
some
aggravated
offence
after
the
offender
is
thus
sentenced
and
the
day
arrives
appointed
by
his
judges
for
its
execution
the
unhappy
wretch
is
conducted
into
the
ship’s
launch--a
large
boat--which
has
been
previously
rigged
up
with
poles
and
grating
to
which
he
is
seized
up
he
is
attended
by
the
ship’s
surgeon
whose
duty
it
is
to
decide
when
the
power
of
nature’s
endurance
has
been
taxed
to
its
utmost
a
boat
from
every
ship
in
the
fleet
is
also
present
each
carrying
one
or
two
officers
and
two
marines
fully
armed
these
boats
are
connected
by
tow
lines
to
the
launch
these
preparations
made
the
crew
of
the
victim’s
ship
are
ordered
to
man
the
rigging
while
the
boatswain
commences
the
tragedy
when
he
has
administered
one
two
or
three
dozen
lashes
according
to
the
number
of
ships
in
the
fleet
the
prisoner’s
shirt
is
thrown
over
his
gory
back
the
boatswain
returns
on
board
the
hands
are
piped
down
the
drummer
beats
a
mournful
melody
called
the
rogue’s
march
and
the
melancholy
procession
moves
on
arriving
at
the
side
of
another
ship
the
brutal
scene
is
repeated
until
every
crew
in
the
fleet
has
witnessed
it
and
from
one
to
three
hundred
lashes
have
lacerated
the
back
of
the
broken-spirited
tar
to
a
bleeding
pulp
he
is
then
placed
under
the
surgeon’s
care
to
be
fitted
for
duty--_a
ruined
man_--broken
in
spirit
all
sense
of
self-respect
gone
forever
gone
if
he
survive
it
is
only
to
be
like
his
own
brave
bark
when
winds
and
waves
conspire
to
dash
her
on
the
pitiless
strand
a
wretched
hopeless
wreck
a
living
walking
shadow
of
his
former
self
shameful
blot
most
foul
and
disgraceful
stain
on
the
humanity
of
england
how
long
before
this
worse
than
barbarism
will
disappear
before
the
mild
influences
of
civilization
and
christianity
no
plea
of
necessity
can
be
successfully
urged
in
behalf
of
whipping
men
for
if
subordination
or
faithful
adhesion
to
orders
is
expected
to
follow
such
terrible
examples
i
know
from
my
acquaintance
with
the
sufferers
themselves
that
the
expectation
is
vain
one
of
two
results
always
follows
the
victim
either
lives
on
a
lone
dark-minded
broken-spirited
man
despising
himself
and
hating
every
one
because
he
thinks
every
one
hates
him
or
he
lives
with
one
fearful
unyielding
purpose
a
purpose
on
which
he
feeds
and
nourishes
his
galled
mind
as
food
affords
life
and
energy
to
his
physical
constitution--that
purpose
is
revenge
i
have
heard
them
swear--and
the
wild
flashing
eye
the
darkly
frowning
brow
told
how
firm
was
that
intent--that
if
ever
they
should
be
in
battle
they
would
shoot
their
officers
i
have
seen
them
rejoice
over
the
misfortunes
of
their
persecutors
but
more
especially
at
their
death
that
it
has
frequently
led
to
mutiny
is
well
verified
i
have
known
such
severity
to
result
in
actual
murder
while
we
lay
at
lisbon
a
sergeant
of
marines
on
board
a
seventy-four
made
himself
obnoxious
by
repeated
acts
of
tyranny
two
marines
determined
upon
his
death
one
night
unperceived
by
any
they
seized
him
hurried
him
to
the
gangway
and
pitched
him
overboard
the
tide
was
running
strong
the
man
was
drowned
but
for
themselves
his
fate
would
have
remained
a
secret
until
the
great
day
of
judgment
it
was
discovered
by
an
officer
who
accidentally
overheard
them
congratulating
each
other
on
their
achievement
he
betrayed
them
a
court-martial
sentenced
them
they
were
placed
on
deck
with
halters
on
their
necks
two
guns
were
fired
and
when
the
smoke
cleared
away
two
men
were
seen
dangling
from
the
foreyard-arm
only
one
day
previous
a
letter
had
brought
a
discharge
from
the
service
for
one
of
them
poor
fellow
it
came
too
late
he
was
fated
to
a
summary
discharge
from
all
service
in
a
manner
appalling
and
repulsive
to
every
finer
human
feeling
such
are
the
actual
consequences
of
severity
of
discipline
on
board
men
of
war
punishment
leads
to
revenge
revenge
to
punishment
what
is
intended
to
cure
only
aggravates
the
disease
the
evil
enlarges
under
the
remedy
voluntary
subordination
ceases
gloom
overspreads
the
crew
fear
fills
the
breasts
of
the
officers
the
ship
becomes
a
miniature
of
the
house
of
fiends
while
on
the
other
hand
mild
regulations
enforced
without
an
appeal
to
brute
force
are
easily
carried
into
operation
the
sailor
has
a
warm
heart
show
him
personal
kindness
treat
him
as
a
man
he
will
then
be
a
man
he
will
do
anything
for
a
kind
officer
he
will
peril
his
life
for
him
nay
he
will
cheerfully
rush
between
him
and
danger
this
was
done
at
tripoli
when
the
brave
james[3
offered
his
own
arm
to
receive
the
fell
stroke
of
a
turkish
scimitar
aimed
at
the
life
of
the
bold
decatur
on
board
the
frigate
philadelphia
let
naval
officers
let
all
ship-masters
once
fairly
test
the
effect
of
kind
treatment
and
i
am
sure
they
will
never
desire
to
return
to
severity
unless
indeed
they
are
tyrants
at
heart
in
which
case
the
sooner
they
lose
their
commands
the
better
for
their
country
for
no
tyrant
is
truly
brave
or
trustworthy
cowardice
and
meanness
lie
curled
up
in
the
heart
of
every
tyrant
he
is
too
despicable
too
unsafe
to
be
trusted
with
the
responsibilities
of
a
naval
command
such
at
least
is
the
opinion
of
an
old
sailor
one
of
the
greatest
enemies
to
order
and
happiness
in
ships
of
war
is
drunkenness
to
be
drunk
is
considered
by
almost
every
sailor
as
the
acme
of
sensual
bliss
while
many
fancy
that
swearing
and
drinking
are
necessary
accomplishments
in
a
genuine
man-of-war’s-man
hence
it
almost
universally
prevails
in
our
ship
the
men
would
get
drunk
in
defiance
of
every
restriction
were
it
not
for
the
moral
and
physical
ruin
which
follows
its
use
one
might
laugh
at
the
various
contrivances
adopted
to
elude
the
vigilance
of
officers
in
their
efforts
to
procure
rum
some
of
our
men
who
belonged
to
the
boats’
crews
provided
themselves
with
bladders
if
left
ashore
by
their
officers
a
few
moments
they
would
slip
into
the
first
grocery
fill
their
bladders
and
return
with
the
spoil
once
by
the
ship’s
side
the
favorable
moment
was
seized
to
pass
the
interdicted
bladders
into
the
port-holes
to
some
watchful
shipmate
by
whom
it
was
carefully
secreted
to
be
drunk
at
the
first
opportunity
the
liberty
to
go
on
shore
which
is
always
granted
while
in
port
was
sure
to
be
abused
for
drunken
purposes
the
sabbath
was
also
a
day
of
sensuality
true
we
sometimes
had
the
semblance
of
religious
services
when
the
men
were
summoned
aft
to
hear
the
captain
read
the
morning
service
from
the
church
prayer-book
but
usually
it
was
observed
more
as
a
day
of
revelry
than
of
worship
but
at
christmas
our
ship
presented
a
scene
such
as
i
had
never
imagined
the
men
were
permitted
to
have
their
full
swing
drunkenness
ruled
the
ship
nearly
every
man
with
most
of
the
officers
was
in
a
state
of
beastly
intoxication
at
night
here
some
were
fighting
but
were
so
insensibly
drunk
they
hardly
knew
whether
they
struck
the
guns
or
their
opponents
yonder
a
party
were
singing
libidinous
or
bacchanalian
songs
while
all
were
laughing
cursing
swearing
or
hallooing
confusion
reigned
in
glorious
triumph
it
was
the
very
chaos
of
humanity
had
we
been
at
sea
a
sudden
gale
of
wind
must
have
proved
our
destruction
had
we
been
exposed
to
a

we
should
have
fallen
an
easy
prey
to
the
victor
just
as
the
poor
hessians
at

the

the
labors

chapter
iii
shortly
after
the
christmas
debauch
mentioned
in
the
preceding
chapter
news
was
brought
to
the
admiral
that
nine
french
frigates
were
cruising
on
the
spanish
coast
immediately
all
was
excitement
bustle
preparation
through
the
fleet
the
hannibal
and
northumberland
both
seventy-four
gun
ships
the
cæsar
of
eighty
guns
called
by
the
sailors
the
old
bull-dog
a
gun
brig
and
some
others
i
forget
the
names
and
the
macedonian
were
ordered
to
sail
in
pursuit
of
the
french
this
formidable
force
dropped
down
the
river
every
man
composing
it
eagerly
desiring
to
meet
the
enemy
the
enterprise
however
was
unsuccessful
after
cruising
in
vain
for
several
days
the
admiral
signalled
the
fleet
to
return
before
reaching
port
we
fell
in
with
a
scotch
ship
from
greenock
in
a
most
perilous
condition
her
masts
and
rudder
were
gone
while
her
numerous
leaks
were
fast
gaining
on
the
labors
of
the
already
exhausted
crew
at
the
pumps
finding
it
utterly
impossible
to
save
the
vessel
we
took
off
the
crew
and
thus
our
cruise
though
defeated
in
its
main
design
proved
the
means
of
rescuing
several
poor
wretches
from
a
watery
grave
it
is
a
question
worthy
of
consideration
whether
this
was
not
a
really
higher
result
than
if
we
had
found
and
beaten
the
french
and
had
returned
in
a
crippled
state
leaving
some
hundreds
killed
and
wounded
humanity
would
answer
yea
so
far
as
the
effects
of
this
cruise
concerned
our
own
little
frigate
they
were
really
quite
serious
we
were
reefing
topsails
one
night
at
sea
when
the
sailing-master
mr
lewis
in
a
fit
of
ill-humor
threatened
to
flog
some
of
the
men
the
captain
overheard
him
feeling
himself
hurt
by
this
assumption
of
his
own
prerogative
he
told
mr
lewis
that
he
was
captain
in
the
ship
and
it
was
his
business
to
flog
the
men
sharp
words
followed
the
captain
was
exasperated
he
ordered
the
sailing-master
to
be
put
in
irons
here
however
he
exceeded
his
own
power
for
though
he
might
place
the
common
sailor
in
irons
he
might
not
do
so
by
an
officer
with
impunity
accordingly
when
we
reached
lisbon
a
court-martial
sat
on
the
case
which
resulted
in
their
both
being
broken
or
cashiered
this
was
a
hard
blow
for
lord
fitzroy
and
he
obviously
felt
it
most
keenly
it
also
cut
off
my
expectations
of
being
elevated
to
the
quarter
deck
for
although
i
had
never
received
any
direct
encouragement
from
his
lordship
yet
i
had
always
nourished
the
hope
that
ultimately
he
would
keep
the
promise
he
made
to
my
mother
and
do
something
for
my
advancement
now
however
my
hopes
were
destroyed
i
was
doomed
to
the
forecastle
for
life
lord
fitzroy
was
succeeded
by
captain
carson
he
however
was
soon
removed
to
make
way
for
captain
waldegrave
who
proved
to
be
far
more
severe
than
fitzroy
he
and
lieutenant
hope
were
kindred
spirits
cruelty
seemed
to
be
their
delight
for
at
the
presence
of
culprits
tied
to
the
gratings
a
gleam
of
savage
animation
stole
over
their
faces
punishment
was
now
an
almost
every-day
scene
even
the
boys
were
not
permitted
to
escape
a
lad
was
appointed
boatswain
over
them
and
they
were
consigned
to
the
care
of
mr
hope
who
took
especial
delight
in
seeing
them
flogged
what
a
mean
dastardly
spirit
for
a
british
officer
how
utterly
contemptible
he
appears
engaged
in
whipping
a
few
helpless
sailor
boys
yet
thus
he
did
constantly
appear
causing
them
to
be
flogged
for
every
trifling
offence
one
poor
little
fellow
unable
to
tolerate
the
thought
of
the
lash
hid
himself
in
the
cable
tier
for
several
days
he
was
discovered
only
to
be
most
shamefully
punished
these
severities
filled
our
crew
with
discouragement
a
sailor
dreads
the
dishonor
of
the
lash
some
urged
by
a
nice
sense
of
honor
have
preferred
death
to
its
endurance
i
have
heard
of
one
man
who
actually
loaded
himself
with
shot
and
deliberately
walked
overboard
among
our
ship’s
company
the
effects
of
these
severe
measures
showed
themselves
in
frequent
desertions
notwithstanding
the
great
risk
run
by
such
a
bold
measure
for
if
taken
they
were
sure
to
meet
with
a
fearful
retribution
still
many
preferred
the
chance
of
freedom
some
ran
off
when
on
shore
with
the
boats
others
dropped
overboard
in
the
night
and
either
swam
on
shore
or
were
drowned
many
others
were
kept
from
running
away
by
the
strength
of
their
attachment
to
their
old
messmates
and
by
the
hope
of
better
days
of
those
who
escaped
some
were
retaken
by
the
portuguese
who
delighted
to
hunt
them
up
for
a
small
sum
of
money
two
of
my
messmates
named
robert
bell
and
james
stokes
were
taken
in
this
manner
i
felt
greatly
affected
at
losing
their
company
for
they
were
pleasant
fellows
i
felt
a
peculiar
attachment
to
poor
stokes
he
had
taught
me
many
things
which
appertain
to
seamanship
and
had
cared
for
my
interests
with
the
faithfulness
of
a
parent
o
how
anxiously
did
i
desire
they
might
not
be
detected
because
i
knew
if
they
were
that
they
were
doomed
men
but
they
were
taken
by
a
band
of
armed
portuguese
barefooted
desponding
broken
in
spirit
they
were
brought
on
board
only
to
be
put
in
irons
immediately
by
a
fortunate
chance
they
escaped
with
fifty
lashes
instead
of
being
flogged
through
the
fleet
we
had
another
man
who
escaped
named
richard
suttonwood
he
was
very
profane
and
was
much
in
the
habit
of
using
the
word
bloody
hence
he
was
nicknamed
bloody
dick
by
his
shipmates
well
dick
ran
off
he
succeeded
in
getting
on
board
an
english
brig
in
the
merchant
service
but
how
chop-fallen
was
poor
dick
when
he
found
that
this
brig
was
laden
with
powder
for
his
own
frigate
resolving
to
make
the
best
of
the
matter
he
said
nothing
of
his
relation
to
our
frigate
but
as
soon
as
the
brig
dropped
alongside
of
the
macedonian
he
came
on
board
and
surrendered
himself
by
this
means
he
escaped
being
flogged
as
it
was
usual
to
pardon
a
runaway
who
voluntarily
returned
to
his
duty
the
crew
were
all
delighted
at
his
return
as
he
was
quite
popular
among
them
for
his
lively
disposition
and
his
talents
as
a
comic
singer
which
last
gift
is
highly
prized
in
a
man
of
war
so
joyous
were
we
all
at
his
escape
from
punishment
that
we
insisted
on
his
giving
a
concert
which
went
off
well
seated
on
a
gun
surrounded
by
scores
of
the
men
he
sung
a
variety
of
favorite
songs
amid
the
plaudits
and
encores
of
his
rough
auditors
by
such
means
as
these
sailors
contrive
to
keep
up
their
spirits
amidst
constant
causes
of
depression
and
misery
one
is
a
good
singer
another
can
spin
tough
forecastle
yarns
while
a
third
can
crack
a
joke
with
sufficient
point
to
call
out
roars
of
laughter
but
for
these
interludes
life
in
a
man
of
war
with
severe
officers
would
be
absolutely
intolerable
mutiny
or
desertion
would
mark
the
voyages
of
every
such
ship
hence
officers
in
general
highly
value
your
jolly
merry-making
don’t-care
sort
of
seamen
they
know
the
effect
of
their
influence
in
keeping
away
discontented
thought
from
the
minds
of
a
ship’s
company
one
of
these
official
favorites
paid
our
frigate
a
visit
while
we
lay
in
lisbon
we
had
just
finished
breakfast
when
a
number
of
our
men
were
seen
running
in
high
glee
towards
the
main
hatchway
wondering
what
was
going
forward
i
watched
their
proceedings
with
a
curious
eye
the
cause
of
their
joy
soon
appeared
in
the
person
of
a
short
round-faced
merry-looking
tar
who
descended
the
hatchway
amid
cries
of
hurrah
here’s
happy
jack
as
soon
as
the
jovial
little
man
had
set
his
foot
on
the
berth
deck
he
began
a
specimen
of
his
vocal
powers
the
voice
of
song
was
as
triumphant
on
board
the
macedonian
as
it
was
in
days
of
yore
in
the
halls
of
ossian
every
voice
was
hushed
all
work
was
brought
to
a
standstill
while
the
crew
gathered
round
their
favorite
in
groups
to
listen
to
his
unequalled
performances
happy
jack
succeeded
while
his
visit
lasted
in
communicating
his
own
joyous
feelings
to
our
people
and
they
parted
from
him
at
night
with
deep
regret
a
casual
visitor
in
a
man
of
war
beholding
the
song
the
dance
the
revelry
of
the
crew
might
judge
them
to
be
happy
but
i
know
that
these
things
are
often
resorted
to
because
they
feel
miserable
just
to
drive
away
dull
care
they
do
it
on
the
same
principle
as
the
slave
population
in
the
south
to
drown
in
sensual
gratification
the
voice
of
misery
that
groans
in
the
inner
man--that
lives
within
speaking
of
the
indignity
offered
to
its
high
nature
by
the
chain
that
eats
beyond
the
flesh--discoursing
of
the
rights
of
man
of
liberty
on
the
free
hills
of
a
happier
clime
while
amidst
the
gayest
negro
dance
not
a
heart
among
the
laughing
gang
but
would
beat
with
high
emotions
and
seize
the
boon
with
indescribable
avidity
should
it
be
offered
its
freedom
on
the
spot
so
in
a
man
of
war
where
severe
discipline
prevails
though
cheerfulness
smiles
at
times
it
is
only
the
forced
merriment
of
minds
ill
at
ease
minds
that
would
gladly
escape
the
thraldom
of
the
hated
service
to
which
they
are
bound
nor
is
this
forced
submission
to
circumstances
universal
there
are
individuals
who
cannot
be
reached
by
these
pleasantries
in
spite
of
everything
their
spirits
will
writhe
under
the
gripe
of
merciless
authority
we
had
a
melancholy
instance
of
this
species
of
mind
on
board
our
frigate
his
name
was
hill
the
ward-room
steward
this
man
came
on
board
with
a
resolute
purpose
to
give
satisfaction
if
possible
to
his
superiors
he
tried
his
utmost
in
vain
he
was
still
scolded
and
cursed
until
his
condition
seemed
unendurable
one
morning
a
boy
entered
the
after
ward-room
when
the
first
object
that
met
his
astonished
eye
was
the
body
of
the
steward
all
ghastly
and
bleeding
he
had
cut
his
throat
and
lay
weltering
in
his
gore
the
surgeon
was
called
who
pronounced
him
to
be
yet
alive
the
wound
was
sewed
up
the
poor
sufferer
carried
to
the
hospital-ship
which
was
in
attendance
on
the
fleet
where
he
recovered
to
be
returned
to
his
former
ship
though
in
another
and
worse
capacity
that
of
common
sailor
we
had
on
board
a
colored
man
whose
name
was
nugent
who
possessed
a
remarkably
fine
person
was
very
intelligent
exceedingly
polite
in
his
manners
and
easy
in
his
address
he
soon
grew
weary
of
the
caprices
of
our
officers
and
ran
away
he
was
taken
however
in
rather
a
curious
manner
the
officers
frequently
walked
the
deck
with
their
spy-glasses
as
one
of
them
was
spending
a
few
leisure
moments
in
looking
at
the
surrounding
shipping
what
should
appear
within
the
field
of
his
glass
but
the
person
of
the
fugitive
nugent
on
the
deck
of
an
american
vessel
upon
this
a
boat
was
despatched
which
soon
returned
with
the
crestfallen
deserter
who
was
unceremoniously
thrown
into
irons
by
some
fortunate
chance
however
he
escaped
a
flogging
of
course
my
situation
was
as
unpleasant
as
that
of
any
other
person
on
board
i
could
not
witness
the
discomfort
and
ill-usage
of
others
without
trembling
for
my
own
back
i
too
had
thoughts
of
running
away
as
opportunities
frequently
offered
themselves
but
being
ignorant
of
the
portuguese
language
i
wisely
concluded
that
my
condition
among
them
if
i
got
clear
would
in
respect
to
my
present
state
bear
about
the
same
analogy
as
the
fire
does
to
the
frying-pan
my
little
adventures
on
shore
gave
me
full
assurance
of
this
fact
i
remember
going
ashore
on
good
friday
like
good
catholics
the
portuguese
had
the
masts
of
their
vessels
crossed
with
effigies
of
the
traitor
judas
hanging
very
significantly
at
their
jib-booms
on
shore
they
were
exhibiting
the
blasphemous
mimicry
of
the
solemn
scene
of
the
crucifixion
one
was
bearing
the
cross
another
a
sponge
a
third
the
vinegar
the
streets
were
crowded
with
images
of
the
saints
to
which
all
reverently
bowed
woe
betide
that
sacrilegious
wretch
who
refused
this
tribute
to
their
darling
images
he
was
sure
of
being
knocked
down
he
was
not
sure
of
getting
home
alive
i
was
fain
to
yield
my
knees
to
save
my
skull
so
for
the
time
i
was
as
good
a
catholic
as
any
of
them
at
least
in
the
matter
of
bowing
and
crossing
it
was
done
however
with
true
protestant
mental
reservation
and
with
a
sincere
determination
to
prefer
my
man-of-war’s
life
to
a
life
in
portugal
on
another
occasion
some
of
our
officers
took
me
on
shore
to
help
them
attend
to
some
purchases
after
following
them
a
considerable
distance
they
gave
me
a
small
commission
to
execute
with
directions
to
return
to
the
ship
as
soon
as
it
was
attended
to
this
was
no
easy
task
however
they
had
conducted
me
to
a
strange
part
of
the
city
and
i
knew
scarcely
a
word
of
portuguese
there
i
stood
then
surrounded
only
by
foreigners
who
neither
understood
my
language
nor
i
theirs
all
i
knew
of
my
destination
was
that
our
boat
lay
near
the
fish-market
so
for
fish-market
i
inquired
speaking
in
english
i
asked
the
first
man
i
met
to
direct
me
he
looked
at
me
with
the
empty
stare
of
an
idiot
and
passed
on
to
the
next
i
said
partly
in
broken
portuguese
and
partly
in
my
own
tongue
john
they
call
everybody
john
whose
true
name
they
do
not
know
do
show
me
the
fish-market
he
could
not
understand
me
so
shrugging
his
shoulders
he
said
no
entender
englis
and
passed
on
i
asked
several
others
but
invariably
received
a
shrug
of
the
shoulder
a
shake
of
the
head
and
a
no
entender
englis
for
an
answer
i
grew
desperate
and
began
to
feel
as
if
i
had
lost
myself
when
to
my
unutterable
satisfaction
i
saw
an
english
soldier
i
ran
up
to
him
and
said
good
luck
to
you
do
tell
me
where
the
fish-market
is
for
these
stupid
portuguese
bad
luck
to
them
can’t
understand
a
word
i
say
but
it
is
all
no
entender
englis
my
countryman
laughed
at
seeing
my
english
temper
ruffled
and
placed
me
in
the
way
of
reaching
the
fish-market
i
hurried
thither
when
to
my
chagrin
the
boats
were
all
gone
here
then
was
another
difficulty
for
though
there
were
plenty
of
portuguese
boatmen
they
could
not
understand
which
ship
i
wished
to
reach
here
however
my
fingers
did
what
my
tongue
refused
our
ship
had
its
mainmast
out
so
holding
up
two
fingers
and
pointing
to
the
mast
they
at
last
comprehended
me
and
conveyed
me
on
board
coming
alongside
i
gave
them
what
i
thought
was
right
but
they
and
i
differed
in
opinion
on
that
point
they
demanded
more
with
considerable
bluster
but
the
sentry
shouted
shove
off
there
and
pointed
his
musket
at
them
whether
they
thought
a
reasonable
fee
and
a
timely
retreat
better
than
a
contest
which
might
give
them
the
taste
of
a
musket-ball
i
cannot
determine
at
all
events
i
know
that
boat
never
left
ship
faster
than
theirs
when
they
beheld
the
gleam
of
the
sentry’s
musket
flashing
in
their
dark
faces
just
after
this
adventure
i
came
very
near
being
flogged
to
my
no
small
alarm
happening
on
shore
with
two
more
of
the
officers’
servants
named
yates
and
skinner
we
stayed
so
late
the
ship’s
boats
had
all
gone
off
finding
the
boats
gone
we
strayed
back
into
the
city
night
came
on
and
our
return
until
morning
was
impossible
we
had
to
wander
about
the
city
all
night
in
constant
fear
of
being
apprehended
by
the
portuguese
as
deserters
to
prevent
this
no
very
desirable
result
my
comrades
made
me
a
midshipman
for
the
satisfactory
reason
that
if
an
officer
was
supposed
to
be
in
our
company
no
one
would
trouble
us
the
summary
process
by
which
i
was
inducted
into
my
new
station
was
by
means
of
a
stripe
carefully
marked
on
my
collar
with
a
piece
of
chalk
to
imitate
the
silver
lace
on
a
middy’s
coat
thus
exalted
i
marched
my
company
about
lisbon
until
dawn
when
i
again
found
myself
the
self-same
samuel
leech
servant
to
the
surgeon
of
h
m
frigate
macedonian
that
i
was
the
previous
evening
with
this
additional
fact
however
i
was
now
liable
to
be
flogged
so
in
the
true
spirit
of
a
jeremy
sneak
we
went
on
board
where
with
due
ceremony
we
were
parted
for
separate
examinations
what
tale
my
fellow-wanderers
invented
i
know
not
for
my
own
part
i
told
the
truth
of
the
matter
excepting
that
i
suppressed
that
part
of
it
which
related
to
my
transformation
into
an
officer
luckily
for
us
all
one
of
the
party
was
the
first
lieutenant’s
servant
if
he
flogged
one
he
must
flog
the
whole
to
save
the
back
of
his
own
boy
he
let
us
all
escape
we
were
now
ordered
on
another
cruise
being
in
want
of
men
we
resorted
to
the
press-gang
which
was
made
up
of
our
most
loyal
men
armed
to
the
teeth
by
their
aid
we
obtained
our
full
numbers
among
them
were
a
few
americans
they
were
taken
without
respect
to
their
protections
which
were
often
taken
from
them
and
destroyed
some
were
released
through
the
influence
of
the
american
consul
others
less
fortunate
were
carried
to
sea
to
their
no
small
chagrin.[4
the
duties
of
the
press-gang
completed
we
once
more
weighed
anchor
and
were
soon
careering
before
the
gales
of
the
bay
of
biscay
our
reception
in
this
proverbially
stormy
bay
was
by
no
means
a
civil
one
we
met
with
an
extraordinarily
severe
gale
in
which
we
came
very
near
foundering
we
had
just
finished
dinner
when
a
tremendous
sea
broke
over
us
pouring
down
the
hatchway
sweeping
the
galley
of
all
its
half-cooked
contents
then
being
prepared
for
the
officers’
dinner
and
covering
the
berth
deck
with
a
perfect
flood
it
seemed
as
if
old
neptune
really
intended
that
wave
to
sink
us
to
davy
jones’
locker
as
the
water
rolled
from
side
to
side
within
and
the
rude
waves
without
beat
against
her
our
good
ship
trembled
from
stem
to
stern
and
seemed
like
a
human
being
gasping
for
breath
in
a
struggle
with
death
the
women
there
were
several
on
board
set
up
a
shriek
a
thing
they
had
never
done
before
some
of
the
men
turned
pale
others
cursed
and
tried
to
say
witty
things
the
officers
started
orders
ran
along
the
ship
to
man
the
chain-pumps
and
to
cut
holes
through
the
berth
deck
to
let
the
water
into
the
hold
these
orders
being
rapidly
obeyed
the
ship
was
freed
from
her
danger
the
confusion
of
the
moment
was
followed
by
laughing
and
pleasantries
that
gale
was
long
spoken
of
as
one
of
great
danger
it
is
strange
that
sailors
who
see
so
much
peril
should
treat
religion
with
such
neglect
as
it
is
usual
for
them
to
do
when
danger
is
imminent
they
send
up
a
cry
for
help
when
it
is
past
they
rarely
return
a
grateful
thank-offering
yet
how
truly
and
eloquently
has
the
psalmist
shown
in
the
107th
psalm
what
should
be
the
moral
effect
of
the
wonders
of
the
deep
what
but
a
deep-rooted
spiritual
perversity
prevents
such
an
effect
the
next
incident
that
disturbed
the
monotony
of
our
sea-life
was
of
a
melancholy
character
we
had
been
giving
chase
to
two
west
indiamen
the
whole
of
one
sabbath
afternoon
at
night
it
blew
so
hard
we
had
to
reef
top-sails
when
a
poor
fellow
named
john
thomson
was
knocked
from
the
yard
in
falling
he
struck
some
part
of
the
ship
and
the
wave
which
opened
to
receive
him
never
disclosed
his
form
again
he
was
a
pressed
man
an
american
by
birth
greatly
beloved
by
his
messmates
by
whom
his
death
was
as
severely
felt
as
when
a
member
of
a
family
dies
on
shore
his
loss
created
a
dull
and
gloomy
atmosphere
throughout
the
ship
it
was
several
days
before
the
hands
regained
their
wonted
elasticity
of
mind
and
appearance
my
recollections
of
this
cruise
are
very
feeble
and
indistinct
owing
to
a
severe
injury
which
confined
me
to
my
hammock
nearly
the
whole
period
the
accident
which
ended
in
a
severe
illness
had
its
origin
in
the
following
manner
the
duty
of
cleaning
knives
plates
dish-covers
c
for
the
ward-room
devolved
alternately
on
the
boys
employed
in
the
ward-room
having
finished
this
task
one
day
in
my
regular
turn
the
ward-room
steward
a
little
hot-headed
malay
came
to
me
at
dinner-time
to
inquire
for
the
knives
not
recollecting
for
the
moment
i
made
no
reply
when
he
angrily
pushed
me
over
a
sack
of
bread
in
falling
my
head
came
in
contact
with
the
corner
of
a
locker
feeling
much
pain
and
the
blood
flowing
freely
i
went
to
mr
marsh
the
surgeon’s
mate
who
dressed
it
and
bade
me
take
care
of
it
probably
it
would
have
healed
speedily
but
for
the
freak
of
a
sailor
a
few
days
after
while
holy-stoning
the
decks
by
holy-stoning
i
mean
cleaning
them
with
stones
which
are
used
for
this
purpose
in
men
of
war
these
stones
are
some
of
them
large
with
a
ring
at
each
end
with
a
rope
attached
by
which
it
is
pulled
backwards
and
forwards
on
the
wet
decks
these
large
stones
are
called
holy
bibles
the
smaller
hand
ones
are
also
called
holy-stones
or
prayer-books
their
shape
being
something
like
a
book
after
the
decks
are
well
rubbed
with
these
stones
they
are
wiped
dry
with
swabs
made
of
rope-yarns
by
this
means
the
utmost
cleanliness
is
preserved
in
the
ship
it
was
customary
in
our
ship
during
this
scrubbing
process
for
the
boys
to
wash
themselves
in
a
large
tub
provided
for
the
purpose
on
the
main
deck
the
men
delighted
in
sousing
us
with
water
during
this
operation
after
being
wounded
as
just
mentioned
i
endeavored
to
avoid
their
briny
libations
but
one
morning
one
of
the
sailors
seeing
my
anxiety
crept
slily
up
behind
me
and
emptied
a
pail
of
water
directly
over
my
head
that
night
i
began
both
to
look
and
to
feel
sick
my
messmates
said
i
was
sea-sick
and
laughed
at
me
feeling
violent
pains
in
my
head
ears
and
neck
i
felt
relieved
when
it
was
time
to
turn
in
the
next
morning
being
rather
behind
my
usual
time
in
waiting
upon
the
surgeon
he
began
to
scold
me
i
told
him
i
was
unwell
he
felt
my
pulse
examined
my
tongue
and
excused
me
growing
worse
my
messmates
got
down
my
hammock
i
entered
it
very
sick
my
head
and
face
swelling
very
large
and
my
eyes
so
sunken
i
could
scarcely
see
i
remained
in
this
sad
situation
several
weeks
carefully
attended
by
the
surgeon
and
watched
by
the
men
as
tenderly
as
their
rough
hands
could
perform
the
office
of
nurse
my
destiny
was
considered
as
being
sealed
both
by
the
crew
and
by
myself
i
was
much
troubled
at
the
thought
of
dying
it
seemed
dark
and
dreary
to
enter
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
without
the
presence
of
a
saviour
to
relieve
my
feelings
i
frequently
repeated
the
lord’s
prayer
taught
me
by
my
indulgent
mother
in
my
earlier
and
brighter
years
but
my
mind
was
dark
and
disconsolate
there
were
none
among
that
kind-hearted
but
profligate
crew
to
point
my
soul
to
its
proper
rest
while
lying
in
this
state
my
life
hanging
in
a
doubtful
balance
one
of
the
crew
named
black
tom
an
african
was
taken
sick
his
hammock
was
hung
up
in
the
sick
bay
a
part
of
the
main
deck
appropriated
to
hospital
purposes
poor
tom
having
a
constitution
already
undermined
by
former
excesses
soon
fell
under
the
attack
of
disease
he
was
then
sewed
up
in
his
hammock
with
some
shot
at
his
feet
at
sundown
the
ship’s
bell
pealed
a
melancholy
note
the
ship
was
hove
to
all
hands
mustered
on
deck
but
myself
and
amid
the
most
profound
silence
the
body
of
the
departed
sailor
was
laid
upon
the
grating
and
launched
into
the
great
deep
the
resting-place
of
many
a
bold
head
a
plunge
a
sudden
opening
in
the
water
followed
by
an
equally
sudden
return
of
the
disparted
waves
and
black
tom
was
gone
forever
from
his
shipmates
in
a
few
moments
the
yards
were
braced
round
and
our
frigate
was
cutting
her
way
again
through
the
wide
ocean
waste
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
was
soon
destined
to
heave
to
again
that
i
might
also
be
consigned
to
an
ocean
grave
but
in
this
i
was
happily
disappointed
by
the
blessing
of
a
watchful
providence
the
aid
of
a
sound
constitution
assisted
by
the
skill
of
our
surgeon
and
the
kindness
of
my
shipmates
i
was
at
last
able
to
leave
my
hammock
shortly
after
our
return
to
lisbon
i
was
pronounced
fit
for
duty
and
the
surgeon
having
obtained
another
boy
i
was
placed
on
the
quarter
deck
in
the
capacity
of
messenger
or
errand
boy
for
the
captain
and
his
officers
with
my
return
to
active
life
came
my
exposure
to
hardships
and
what
i
dreaded
still
more
to
punishment
some
of
the
boys
were
to
be
punished
on
the
main
deck
the
rest
were
ordered
forward
to
witness
it
as
usual
being
so
far
aft
that
i
could
not
hear
the
summons
as
a
matter
of
course
i
remained
at
my
post
the
hawk-eye
of
the
lieutenant
missed
me
and
in
a
rage
he
ordered
me
to
be
sent
for
to
receive
a
flogging
for
my
absence
excuse
was
vain
for
such
was
the
fiendish
temper
of
this
brutal
officer
he
only
wanted
the
shadow
of
a
reason
for
dragging
the
poor
helpless
boys
of
his
charge
to
the
grating
while
i
stood
in
trembling
expectation
of
being
degraded
by
the
hated
cat
a
summons
from
the
captain
providentially
called
off
our
brave
boy-flogger
and
i
escaped
the
offence
was
never
mentioned
afterwards
the
reader
can
easily
perceive
how
such
a
constant
exposure
to
the
lash
must
embitter
a
seaman’s
life
already
since
the
macedonian
had
been
in
commission
had
she
changed
captains
twice
why
it
so
happened
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
explain
but
while
at
lisbon
after
the
cruise
last
mentioned
our
present
captain
was
superseded
by
captain
john
s
carden
his
arrival
excited
a
transitory
hope
of
a
brighter
lot
as
he
was
an
older
man
than
the
others
and
as
we
vainly
trusted
a
kinder
one
here
however
we
were
mistaken
he
was
like
all
the
rest
the
same
heartless
unfeeling
lover
of
whip
discipline
at
first
the
men
under
sentence
tried
their
powers
at
flattery
with
the
grave
old
man
but
he
was
too
experienced
a
sea-dog
to
be
cajoled
by
a
long-faced
sailor
under
sentence
when
therefore
they
told
him
he
was
a
kind-hearted
fatherly
gentleman
he
only
replied
by
a
most
provoking
laugh
and
by
saying
they
were
a
set
of
very
undutiful
sons
captain
carden
was
mercilessly
severe
in
punishing
theft
he
would
on
no
account
forgive
any
man
for
this
crime
but
would
flog
the
thief
almost
to
death
of
this
we
soon
had
a
cruel
instance
a
midshipman
named
gale
a
most
rascally
unprincipled
fellow
found
his
pocket
handkerchief
in
possession
of
one
of
the
crew
he
charged
the
man
with
stealing
it
it
was
in
vain
that
the
poor
wretch
asserted
that
he
found
it
under
his
hammock
he
was
reported
as
a
thief
a
court-martial
sat
upon
him
and
returned
the
shamefully
disproportionate
sentence
of
three
hundred
lashes
through
the
fleet
and
one
year’s
imprisonment
any
of
my
shipmates
who
are
living
will
certify
to
the
truth
of
this
statement
brutal
and
improbable
as
it
may
appear
nor
was
that
sentence
a
dead
letter
the
unhappy
man
endured
it
to
the
letter
fifty
were
laid
on
alongside
of
the
macedonian
in
conformity
with
a
common
practice
of
inflicting
the
most
strokes
at
the
first
ship
in
order
that
the
gory
back
of
the
criminal
may
strike
the
more
terror
into
the
crews
of
the
other
ships
this
poor
tortured
man
bore
two
hundred
and
twenty
and
was
pronounced
by
the
attending
surgeon
unfit
to
receive
the
rest
galled
bruised
and
agonized
as
he
was
he
besought
him
to
suffer
the
infliction
of
the
remaining
eighty
that
he
might
not
be
called
to
pass
through
the
degrading
scene
again
but
this
prayer
was
denied
he
was
brought
on
board
and
when
his
wounds
were
healed
the
captain
shylock-like
determined
to
have
the
whole
pound
of
flesh
ordered
him
to
receive
the
remainder
but
for
my
desire
to
present
the
reader
with
a
true
exhibition
of
life
on
board
a
british
man
of
war
it
would
be
my
choice
to
suppress
these
disgusting
details
of
cruelty
and
punishment
but
this
is
impossible
i
must
either
draw
a
false
picture
or
describe
them
i
choose
the
latter
in
the
hope
that
giving
publicity
to
these
facts
will
exert
a
favorable
influence
on
the
already
improving
discipline
of
ships
of
war
the
case
of
our
ship’s
drummer
will
illustrate
the
hopelessness
of
our
situation
under
such
officers
as
commanded
our
ship
it
will
show
that
implicit
uncomplaining
submission
was
our
only
resource
this
drummer
being
seized
up
for
some
petty
offence
demanded
what
no
captain
can
refuse
to
be
tried
by
a
court-martial
in
the
hope
probably
of
escaping
altogether
the
officers
laughed
among
each
other
and
when
a
few
days
afterwards
the
poor
affrighted
man
offered
to
withdraw
the
demand
and
take
six
dozen
lashes
they
coolly
remarked
the
drummer
is
sick
of
his
bargain
he
would
have
been
a
wiser
man
had
he
never
made
it
for
the
court-martial
sentenced
him
to
receive
two
hundred
lashes
through
the
fleet:--a
punishment
ostensibly
for
his
first
offence
but
really
for
his
insolence

in
demanding
a
trial
by
court-martial
such
was
the
administration
of
justice

on
board
the
macedonian
why
did
not
your
crew
rise
in
resistance
to
such
cruelty
is
a
question
which
has
often
been
proposed
to
me
when
relating
these
facts
to
my
american
friends
to
talk
of
mutiny
on
shore
is
an
easy
matter
but
to
excite
it
on
shipboard
is
to
rush
on
to
certain
death
let
it
be
known
that
a
man
has
dared
to
breathe
the
idea
and
he
is
sure
to
swing
at
the
yard-arm
some
of
our
men
once
saw
six
mutineers
hanging
at
the
yard-arm
at
once
in
a
ship
whose
crew
exhibited
the
incipient
beginnings
of
mutiny
let
mutiny
be
successful
the
government
will
employ
its
whole
force
if
needful
in
hunting
down
the
mutineers
their
blood
to
the
last
drop
is
the
terrible
retribution
it
demands
for
this
offence
that
demand
is
sure
to
be
met
as
was
the
case
with
the
crew
of
the
hermione_[5
frigate
and
with
the
crew
of
the
ill-fated
bounty
whose
history
is
imprinted
on
the
memory
of
the
whole
civilized
world
with
such
tragedies
flitting
before
our
eyes
who
need
ask
why
we
did
not
resist
just
before
we
left
lisbon
for
another
cruise
my
position
was
once
more
changed
by
my
appointment
to
the
post
of
servant
to
the
sailing-master
whose
boy
for
some
offence
or
other
was
flogged
and
turned
away
here
too
the
captain
procured
a
fine
band
composed
of
frenchmen
italians
and
germans
taken
by
the
portuguese
from
a
french
vessel
these
musicians
consented
to
serve
on
condition
of
being
excused
from
fighting
and
on
a
pledge
of
exemption
from
being
flogged
they
used
to
play
to
the
captain
during
his
dinner
hour
the
party
to
be
amused
usually
consisting
of
the
captain
and
one
or
two
invited
guests
from
the
ward-room
except
on
sundays
when
he
chose
to
honor
the
ward-room
with
his
august
presence
the
band
then
played
for
the
ward-room
they
also
played
on
deck
whenever
we
entered
or
left
a
port
on
the
whole
their
presence
was
an
advantage
to
the
crew
since
their
spirit-stirring
strains
served
to
spread
an
occasional
cheerful
influence
over
them
soon
after
they
came
on
board
we
had
orders
to
proceed
to
sea
again
on
another
cruise

iv
a
few
days
after
we
had
fairly
got
out
to
sea
the
thrilling
cry
of
a
man
overboard
ran
through
the
ship
with
electrical
effect
it
was
followed
by
another
cry
of
heave

rope
then
by
still
another
of
cut

then
came
the
order
lower
a
boat
notwithstanding
the
rapidity
of
these
commands
and
the
confusion
occasioned
by
the
anticipated
loss
of
a
man
they
were
rapidly
obeyed
the
ship
was
then
hove
to
but
that
time
however
the
cause
of
all
this
excitement
was
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
ship
it
was
a
poor
swede
named
logholm
who
while
engaged
in
lashing
the
larboard
anchor
stock
lost
his
hold
and
fell
into
the
sea
he
could
not
swim
but
somehow
he
managed
to
keep
afloat
until
the
boat
reached
him
when
he
began
to
sink
the
man
at
the
bow

caught

the
active
bowsman
ran
the
hook
down
leaning
far
over
the
side
fortunately
he
got
hold
of
his
shirt
collar
dripping
and
apparently
lifeless
they
drew
him
into
the
boat
he
was
soon
under
the
surgeon’s
care
whose
skill
restored
him
to
animation
and
to
life
it
was
a
narrow
escape
rising
one
morning
i
heard
the
men
talking
about
having
been
called
to
quarters
during
the
night
they
said
a
strange
vessel
having
appeared
the
drums
beat
to
quarters
the
guns
were
got
ready
those
great
lanterns
which
are
placed
on
the
main
deck
called
battle
lanterns
were
got
out
and
the
officers
began
to
muster
the
men
at
each
division
when
they
discovered
the
supposed
vessel
of
war
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
large
merchant
ship
upon
this
the
hands
were
sent
below
all
this
was
news
to
me
i
had
slept
through
all
the
noise
confusion
and
bustle
of
the
night
utterly
ignorant
of
the
whole
matter
it
was
fortunate
for
me
that
the
real
character
of
the
strange
ship
was
discovered
before
my
name
was
called

the
morning
would
have
found
me
at
the
gratings
under
punishment
never
was
boy
happier
than
myself
when
made
acquainted
with
my
hair-breadth
escape
from
the
lash
we
had
now
reached
the
island
of
madeira
occupied
by
the
portuguese
and
producing
fine
oranges
grapes
and

it

some
sixty
miles
in

about
forty

climate

hot

salubrious

who
had
supplied
my
place
as
servant
to
the
surgeon
was
sent
on
shore
for
attempting
a
crime
unfit
to
be
mentioned
in
these
pages
but
quite
common
among
the
spaniards
and
portuguese
my
old
master
made
an
effort
to
obtain
me
again
but
did
not
succeed
sailing
from
madeira
we
next
made
st
michael’s
at
this
pace
we
had
an
increase
to
our
crew
in
the
person
of
a
fine
plump
boy--born
to
the
wife
of
one
of
our
men
the
captain
christened
the
new
comer
michael
naming
him
after
the
island
this
birth
was
followed
by
another
whether
the
captain
did
not
like
the
idea
of
such
interesting
episodes
in
sea
life
or
whether
any
other
motive
inspired
him
i
cannot
tell
but
when
shortly
after
we
returned
to
lisbon
he
ordered
all
the
women
home
to
england
by
a
ship
just
returning
thither
before
this
however
one
of
our
little
tritons
had
died
and
found
a
grave
under
the
billows
leaving
its
disconsolate
mother
in
a
state
little
short
of
distraction
a
man
of
war
is
no
place
for
a
woman
short
cruises
are
very
popular
with
man-of-war’s
men
on
many
accounts
they
love
being
in
harbor
on
others
they
prefer
being
at
sea
in
harbor
they
have
to
work
all
day
but
in
return
for
this
they
have
the
whole
night
for
sleep
at
sea
the
whole
time
is
divided
into
five
watches
of
four
hours
each
and
two
shorter
ones
called
dog
watches
of
two
hours
each
or
from
four
to
six
and
from
six
to
eight
p
m
the
design
of
these
dog
watches
is
to
alternate
the
time
so
that
each
watch
may
have
a
fair
proportion
of
every
night
below
while
at
our
station
this
time
our
old
friend
bob
hammond
met
with
some
little
difficulty
which
we
will
here
make
matter
of
record
he
was
below
and
one
of
his
messmates
did
something
that
vexed
him
exceedingly
now
bob
was
not
a
man
to
bear
vexations
tamely
where
he
had
the
power
to
resist
them
so
lifting
his
huge
fist
he
struck
at
the
offender
missing
his
real
opponent
the
blow
fell
upon
another
who
stood
near
him
bob
was
too
much
of
a
bully
to
offer
any
apology
he
merely
laughed
and
remarked
that
he
had
killed
two
birds
with
one
stone
whether
the
bird
who
in
bob’s
figurative
language
was
killed
did
not
like
being
called
a
bird
or
whether
he
conceived
a
strong
dislike
to
being
a
mark
for
bob
to
shoot
at
is
not
for
me
to
say
but
he
certainly
disliked
the
one
or
the
other
for
the
next
morning
he
reported
the
matter
to
the
officers
which
complaint
was
considered
a
most
unsailor-like
act
by
the
whole
crew
fighting
was
a
punishable
offence
so
bob
was
called
up
the
next
morning
the
captain
mentioned
what
was
reported
concerning
him
he
acknowledged
it
was
all
true
and
without
any
signs
of
contrition
said
i
only
killed
two
birds
with
one
stone
the
angry
captain
ordered
two
dozen
lashes
to
be
laid
on
it
was
done
without
extorting
a
sigh
or
a
groan
he
was
then
loosed
from
the
grating
and
questioned
but
he
merely
replied
in
a
gruff
tone
that
the
man
who
reported
him
was
a
blackguard
for
this
he
was
seized
up
again
and
another
dozen
lashes
inflicted
he
bore
them
with
the
same
dogged
and
imperturbable
air
finding
it
impossible
to
extort
any
acknowledgment
from
the
stubborn
tar
the
captain
ordered
him
below
about
the
same
time
one
of
our
crew
named
jack
sadler
a
fine
noble-hearted
seaman
growing
weary
of
the
service
determined
to
desert
dropping
into
the
water
he
began
swimming
towards
the
shore
it
was
not
very
dark
and
he
was
discovered
the
sentry
was
ordered
to
fire
at
him
which
he
did
but
missed
his
prey
a
boat
was
next
lowered
which
soon
overtook
and
dragged
him
on
board
the
officer
commanding
the
boat
said
well
mr
sadler
you
thought
you
had
got
away
did
you
you
are
not
so
sure
that
you
have
me
now
replied
sadler
as
he
sprung
over
the
side
of
the
boat
nor
would
they
have
captured
him
had
not
another
ship’s
boat
arrived
to
their
assistance
the
next
day
he
was
seized
up
and
received
three
dozen
lashes
which
considering
his
offence
was
a
very
light
punishment
i
suppose
that
his
noble
bearing
his
lion-hearted
courage
and
his
undaunted
manner
produced
a
favorable
feeling
in
the
captain’s
mind
especially
as
he
afterwards
became
his
favorite--a
fancy
man--as
those
men
are
called
who
win
the
favor
of
their
superior
officer
one
of
sadler’s
failings
was
that
too
prevalent
evil
among
seamen
drunkenness
soon
after
the
above
affair
he
got
drunk
being
seen
by
the
captain
he
was
ordered
to
be
put
in
irons
sadler
was
bob
hammond’s
messmate
this
worthy
finding
his
comrade
in
trouble
made
himself
drunk
and
purposely
placed
himself
in
the
way
of
the
officers
that
he
might
be
put
in
irons
also
to
keep
his
friend
sadler
company
the
plan
succeeded
bob
had
his
wish
and
the
two
fearless
tars
were
soon
ironed
together
nothing
daunted
they
began
to
sing
and
through
the
whole
night
they
kept
up
such
a
hallooing
shouting
and
singing
as
might
have
served
for
a
whole
company
of
idle
roysterers
being
near
the
ward-room
they
prevented
the
officers
from
sleeping
nearly
all
night
as
usual
after
being
in
irons
they
were
brought
up
for
punishment
the
next
morning
well
mr
sadler
said
the
captain
you
were
drunk
were
you
last
night
i
was
sir
replied
the
offender
had
he
been
any
other
man
he
would
have
been
ordered
to
strip
as
it
was
the
captain
proceeded
do
you
feel
sorry
for
it
sir
i
do
sir
will
you
try
to
keep
sober
if
i
forgive
you
continued
captain
carden
i
will
try
sir
then
sir
i
forgive
you
and
no
doubt
he
was
glad
to
witness
that
contrition
in
his
favorite
which
made
it
consistent
to
forgive
him
having
dismissed
sadler
he
turned
to
hammond
assuming
a
sterner
look
and
a
harsher
voice
he
said
in
a
tone
of
irony
well
mr
hammond
you
got
drunk
last
night
did
you
sir
bob
shrugged
up
his
shoulders
and
removed
his
enormous
quid
into
a
convenient
position
for
speaking
and
then
replied
i
can’t
say
but
that
i
had
a
horn
of
malt
the
captain
looked
thunder
at
the
stalwart
man
as
he
answered
a
horn
of
malt
you
rascal
what
do
you
call
a
horn
of
malt
when
i
was
in
bengal
madras
and
batavia
said
he
i
used
to
get
some
stuff
called
arrack--we
used
to
call
it
a
horn
of
malt
but
this
was
some
good
rum
bob’s
manner
was
so
exquisitely
ridiculous
while
delivering
this
harangue
that
both
officers
and
men
broke
out
into
an
involuntary
laugh
the
captain
looked
confounded
but
recovering
himself
he
said
to
mr
hope
the
first
lieutenant
put
that
rascal
in
irons
it
is
of
no
use
to
flog
him
one
of
the
peculiarities
of
captain
carden
was
an
ardent
desire
to
have
a
crew
of
picked
first-rate
men
the
shiftless
slovenly
seaman
was
his
abhorrence
had
he
dared
he
would
gladly
have
given
all
such
their
discharge
as
it
was
he
never
attempted
their
recovery
by
offering
a
reward
for
their
detection
if
they
ran
away
while
he
spared
no
pains
to
catch
an
able
active
valuable
man
like
sadler
he
even
gave
these
drones
opportunity
to
escape
by
sending
them
on
shore
at
lisbon
to
cut
stuff
to
make
brooms
for
sweeping
the
deck
the
men
sent
out
on
these
expeditions
were
nicknamed
broomers
now
although
bob
hammond
was
as
expert
a
sailor
as
any
man
in
the
ship
yet
his
unconquerable
audacity
made
the
captain
fear
his
influence
and
wish
to
get
rid
of
him
hence
a
few
days
after
this
drunken
spree
bob
was
called
on
deck
to
go
with
the
broomers
you
may
go
mr
hammond
said
the
captain
eyeing
him
in
a
very
expressive
manner
with
these
fellows
to
cut
broom
bob
understood
the
hint
perfectly
and
replied
aye
aye
sir
and
i
will
cut
a
long
handle
to
it
i
scarcely
need
remark
that
the
broomers
returned
without
bob
whether
he
remained
on
shore
to
cut
the
long
handle
or
for
some
other
purpose
he
never
informed
us
certain
it
is
however
that
the
presence
of
bob
hammond
never
darkened
the
decks
of
the
macedonian
again
about
this
time
the
prevailing
topic
of
conversation
among
our
men
and
officers
was
the
probability
of
a
war
with
america
the
prevailing
feeling
through
the
whole
fleet
was
that
of
confidence
in
our
own
success
and
of
contempt
for
the
inferior
naval
force
of
our
anticipated
enemies
every
man
and
especially
the
officers
predicted
as
his
eye
glanced
proudly
on
the
fine
fleet
which
was
anchored
off
lisbon
a
speedy
and
successful
issue
to
the
approaching
conflict
we
now
received
orders
to
sail
to
norfolk
virginia
with
despatches
the
voyage
was
accomplished
without
any
occurrence
of
note
we
found
ourselves
on
the
american
coast
with
no
very
pleasant
impressions
it
was
late
in
the
fall
and
the
transition
from
the
mild
soft
climate
of
spain
and
portugal
to
the
bleak
sharp
atmosphere
of
the
coast
of
virginia
was
anything
but
delightful
the
most
disagreeable
duty
in
the
ship
was
that
of
holy-stoning
the
decks
on
cold
frosty
mornings
our
movements
were
never
more
elastic
than
when
at
this
really
severe
task
as
usual
it
gave
occasion
to
a
variety
of
forecastle
yarns
about
cold
stations
among
these
was
one
which
was
attested
by
many
witnesses
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
its
truth
a
british
frigate
was
once
stationed
in
a
cold
climate
the
first
lieutenant
was
a
complete
tyrant
delighting
in
everything
that
caused
the
crew
to
suffer
among
other
things
he
took
especial
care
to
make
the
work
of
holy-stoning
as
painful
as
possible
by
forcing
them
to
continue
at
it
much
longer
than
was
necessary
although
he
had
no
watch
on
deck
he
would
contrive
to
be
up
in
season
to
annoy
the
men
with
his
hated
presence
one
morning
the
weather
being
unusually
severe
the
men
sprang
to
their
task
with
unwonted
agility
and
contrived
to
finish
it
before
the
appearance
of
their
persecutor
to
their
vexation
however
just
as
they
had
completed
their
work
he
bounced
on
deck
with
a
peremptory
order
to
wash
the
decks
all
over
a
second
time
the
men
dropped
on
their
knees
with
the
holy-stones
and
prayed
as
the
tyrant
went
below
that
he
might
never
come
on
deck
again
alive
whether
god
heard
the
cry
of
the
oppressed
crew
or
whether
it
was
the
action
of
the
ordinary
natural
laws
the
reader
must
determine
for
himself
but
when
the
lieutenant
again
appeared
on
deck
he
was
brought
up
feet
foremost
to
be
buried
he
was
taken
sick
that
morning
his
disease
baffled
the
skill
of
the
surgeon
and
in
a
few
days
he
was
a
corpse
the
opinion
that
he
died
a
monument
of
the
divine
displeasure
against
cruel
hard-hearted
men
of
power
and
of
disregard
for
the
miseries
and
tears
of
the
oppressed
poor
is
at
least
worthy
of
serious
consideration
soon
after
we
had
descried
land
an
american
pilot
came
on
board
to
pilot
us
into
hampton
roads
the
sound
of
our
own
familiar
tongue
from
a
stranger
was
very
agreeable
to
men
who
had
been
accustomed
to
hear
the
semi-barbarous
lingo
of
the
portuguese
and
a
thrill
of
home
remembrances
shot
through
our
hearts
as
stepping
on
deck
the
pilot
exclaimed
it
is
very
cold
while
at
anchor
in
hampton
roads
we
fared
well
boats
were
alongside
every
day
with
plenty
of
beef
and
pork
which
was
declared
by
universal
consent
to
be
infinitely
superior
to
what
we
obtained
from
portugal
our
men
said
that
the
yankee
pork
would
swell
in
the
pot
which
they
very
sagely
accounted
for
on
the
supposition
that
the
pigs
were
killed
at
the
full
of
the
moon
but
i
suppose
that
virginia
corn
had
more
to
do
in
this
matter
than
lunar
influences
though
our
men
most
doggedly
maintained
the
contrary
and
more
mystical
opinion
the
principal
draw-back
on
the
enjoyment
of
our
stay
at
norfolk
was
the
denial
of
liberty
to
go
on
shore
the
strictest
care
was
taken
to
prevent
all
communication
with
the
shore
either
personally
or
by
letter
the
reason
of
this
prohibition
was
a
fear
lest
we
should
desert
many
of
our
crew
were
americans
some
of
these
were
pressed
men
others
were
much
dissatisfied
with
the
severity
not
to
say
cruelty
of
our
discipline
so
that
a
multitude
of
the
crew
were
ready
to
give
leg
bail
as
they
termed
it
could
they
have
planted
their
feet
on
american
soil
hence
our
liberty
was
restrained
our
officers
never
enjoyed
better
cheer
than
during
our
stay
at
this
port
besides
feasting
among
themselves
on
the
fine
fat
beef
geese
and
turkeys
which
came
alongside
in
abundance
they
exchanged
visits
with
commodore
decatur
and
his
officers
of
the
frigate
united
states
then
lying
at
norfolk
these
visits
were
seasons
of
much
wassail
and
feasting
i
remember
overhearing
commodore
decatur
and
the
captain
of
the
macedonian
joking
about
taking
each
other’s
ship
in
case
of
a
war
and
some
of
the
crew
said
that
a
bet
of
a
beaver
hat
passed
between
them
on
the
issue
of
such
a
conflict
they
probably
little
thought
that
this
joking
over
a
wine-cup
would
afterwards
be
cracked
in
earnest
in
a
scene
of
blood
and
carnage
it
was
at
this
port
that
the
difficulty
between
the
british
ship
leopard
and
the
american
frigate
chesapeake
took
place
several
american
seamen
having
escaped
from
the
former
took
refuge
on
board
the
latter
the
captain
of
the
leopard
demanded
their
restoration
the
captain
of
the
chesapeake
refused
submission
to
the
demand
the
leopard
fired
into
the
frigate
which
being
of
inferior
force
struck
to
her
opponent
as
it
was
a
time
of
peace
the
chesapeake
was
not
kept
as
a
prize
the
claimed
men
were
taken
from
her
and
she
was
restored
this
was
among
the
circumstances
which
led
to
the
war
of
1812
the
despatches
delivered
and
the
object
of
the
voyage
accomplished
we
once
more
put
to
sea
having
first
laid
in
a
liberal
store
of
our
favorite
beef
together
with
a
quantity
of
virginia
beans
called
calavances
which
were
in
high
favor
with
our
men
to
those
of
our
crew
who
were
americans
this
was
rather
an
unpleasant
event
like
the
fabled
tantalus
they
had
the
cup
at
their
mouths
but
it
receded
before
they
could
taste
its
contents
they
had
been
at
the
threshold
of
home
sweet
home
but
had
not
been
permitted
to
step
within
its
doors
some
of
them
felt
this
very
keenly
especially
a
boy
who
belonged
to
new
york
named
jesse
lloyd
in
truth
it
was
a
hard
lot
a
quick
winter
passage
brought
us
to
lisbon
where
the
arrival
of
the
english
mail-bag
and
orders
to
proceed
to
england
with
a
convoy
of
merchantmen
put
us
all
into
a
tolerably
good
humor
the
arrival
of
the
mail-bag
is
a
season
of
peculiar
interest
on
board
a
man
of
war
it
calls
the
finer
feelings
of
human
nature
into
exercise
it
awakens
conjugal
fraternal
and
filial
affection
in
almost
every
breast
the
men
crowd
around
as
the
letters
are
distributed
and
he
was
pronounced
a
happy
fellow
whose
name
was
read
off
by
the
distributor
while
those
who
had
none
to
hide
their
disappointment
would
jocularly
offer
to
buy
those
belonging
to
their
more
fortunate
messmates
during
the
two
years
of
our
absence
i
had
received
several
letters
from
my
mother
which
afforded
me
much
satisfaction
to
these
i
had
faithfully
replied
i
now
experienced
the
advantage
of
the
primary
education
i
had
received
when
a
boy
many
of
my
shipmates
could
neither
read
nor
write
and
were
in
consequence
either
altogether
deprived
of
the
privilege
of
intercourse
with
their
friends
or
were
dependent
on
the
kindness
of
others
to
read
and
write
for
them
for
these
i
acted
as
a
sort
of
scribe
i
also
solaced
many
weary
hours
by
reading
such
works
as
could
be
obtained
from
the
officers
and
sometimes
i
perused
the
bible
and
prayer
book
which
my
mother
so
wisely
placed
in
my
chest
on
the
eve
of
my
departure
the
pack
of
cards
which
so
inappropriately
accompanied
them
i
had
loaned
to
one
of
the
officers
who
took
the
liberty
to
keep
them
this
was
perhaps
more
fortunate
than
otherwise
since
their
possession
might
have
led
to
their
use
and
their
use
might
have
excited
a
propensity
to
gambling
which
would
have
ended
in
my
ruin
after
remaining
a
very
short
time
at
lisbon
we
one
morning
fired
a
gun
to
give
notice
to
our
convoy
to
get
under
weigh
immediately
the
harbor
was
alive
with
noise
and
activity
the
song
of
the
sailors
weighing
anchor
the
creaking
of
pulleys
the
flapping
of
the
sails
the
loud
gruff
voices
of
the
officers
and
the
splashing
of
the
waters
created
what
was
to
us
now
that
we
were
homeward
bound
a
sweet
harmony
of
sounds
amid
all
this
animation
our
own
stately
frigate
spread
her
bellying
sails
to
a
light
but
favoring
breeze
with
colors
flying
our
band
playing
lively
airs
and
the
captain
with
his
speaking
trumpet
urging
the
lagging
merchant-ships
to
more
activity
we
passed
gaily
through
the
large
fleet
consigned
to
our
care
in
this
gallant
style
we
scudded
past
the
straggling
ruins
of
old
lisbon
which
still
bore
marks
of
the
earthquake
that
destroyed
it
very
soon
the
merry
fishermen
who
abound
in
the
tagus
were
far
at
our
stern
next
we
glided
past
the
tall
granite
pinnacles
of
towering
mount
cintra
the
high-lands
passed
from
our
vision
like
the
scenes
in
a
panorama
and
in
a
few
hours
instead
of
the
companionship
of
the
large
flocks
of
gulls
which
abound
in
this
river
we
were
attended
by
only
here
and
there
one
of
these
restless
wanderers
of
the
deep
we
were
fairly
at
sea
and
what
was
the
more
inspiring
we
were
enjoying
the
luxury
of
fond
anticipation
visions
of
many
an
old
fire-side
of
many
a
humble
hearth-stone
poor
but
precious
flitted
across
the
visions
of
our
crew
that
night
hardships
severe
discipline
were
for
the
time
forgotten
in
the
dreams
of
hope
would
that
i
could
say
that
everything
in
every
mind
was
thus
absorbed
in
pleasure
there
were
minds
that
writhed
under
what
is
never
forgotten
like
the
scar
that
time
may
heal
but
not
remove
the
flogged
man
forgets
not
that
he
has
been
degraded
the
whip
when
it
scarred
the
flesh
went
farther
it
wounded
the
spirit
it
struck
the
man
it
begat
a
sense
of
degradation
he
must
carry
with
him
to
his
grave
we
had
many
such
on
board
our
frigate
their
laugh
sounded
empty
and
sometimes
their
look
became
suddenly
vacant
in
the
midst
of
hilarity
it
was
the
whip
entering
the
soul
anew
but
the
most
of
our
crew
were
for
the
time
happy
they
were
homeward
bound
chapter
v
after
running
a
few
days
before
a
fair
wind
the
delightful
cry
of
land
ho
was
heard
from
the
mast-head
a
cry
always
pleasant
to
the
inhabitant
of
a
ship
but
most
especially
so
when
the
distant
hills
are
those
of
his
native
land
soon
after
the
cry
of
the
man
aloft
the
land
became
dimly
visible
from
the
deck
and
our
eyes
glistened
as
the
bright
emerald
fields
of
old
england
in
all
the
glory
of
their
summer
beauty
lay
spread
out
before
us
ascending
the
british
channel
we
soon
made
the
spacious
harbor
of
plymouth
where
we
came
to
an
anchor
one
of
our
convoy
however
by
some
unskilful
management
ran
ashore
at
the
mouth
of
the
harbor
where
she
went
to
pieces
we
found
plymouth
to
be
a
naval
station
of
considerable
importance
well
fortified
possessing
extensive
barracks
for
the
accommodation
of
the
military
and
having
a
magnificent
dock-yard
abundantly
supplied
with
the
means
of
building
and
refitting
the
wooden
walls
nothing
would
have
afforded
me
a
higher
gratification
than
a
trip
to
the
pleasant
fields
and
quiet
hearth-sides
of
dear
old
bladen
i
longed
to
pour
out
my
pent-up
griefs
into
the
bosom
of
my
mother
and
to
find
that
sympathy
which
is
sought
in
vain
in
the
cold
unfeeling
world
this
privilege
was
however
denied
to
all
no
one
could
obtain
either
leave
of
absence
or
money
since
a
man
of
war
is
never
paid
off
until
just
before
she
proceeds
to
sea
but
feeling
heartily
tired
of
the
service
i
wrote
to
my
mother
requesting
her
to
endeavor
to
procure
my
discharge
this
with
the
promptitude
of
maternal
affection
she
pledged
herself
to
do
at
the
earliest
possible
opportunity
how
undying
is
a
mother’s
love
when
a
man
of
war
is
in
port
it
is
usual
to
grant
the
crew
occasional
liberty
to
go
on
shore
these
indulgences
are
almost
invariably
abused
for
purposes
of
riot
drunkenness
and
debauchery
rarely
does
it
happen
but
that
these
shore
sprees
end
in
bringing
poor
jack
into
difficulty
of
some
sort
for
once
on
shore
he
is
like
an
uncaged
bird
as
gay
and
quite
as
thoughtless
he
will
then
follow
out
the
dictates
of
passions
and
appetites
let
them
lead
him
whither
they
may
still
there
are
exceptions
there
are
a
few
who
spend
their
time
more
rationally
were
the
principles
of
modern
temperance
fully
triumphant
among
sailors
they
would
all
do
so
i
resolved
not
to
abuse
my
liberty
as
i
saw
others
doing
so
when
one
fine
sabbath
morning
i
had
obtained
leave
from
our
surly
first
lieutenant
i
chose
the
company
of
a
brother
to
a
messmate
named
rowe
who
lived
at
plymouth
at
the
request
of
my
messmate
i
called
to
see
him
he
received
me
very
kindly
and
took
me
in
company
with
his
children
into
the
fields
where
the
merry
notes
of
the
numerous
birds
the
rich
perfume
of
the
blooming
trees
the
tall
green
hedges
and
the
modest
primroses
cowslips
and
violets
which
adorned
the
banks
on
the
road-side
filled
me
with
inexpressible
delight
true
this
was
not
the
proper
manner
of
spending
a
sabbath
day
but
it
was
better
than
it
would
have
been
to
follow
the
example
of
my
shipmates
generally
who
were
carousing
in
the
tap-rooms
of
the
public
houses
at
sunset
i
went
on
board
and
walked
aft
to
the
lieutenant
to
report
myself
he
appeared
surprised
to
see
me
on
board
so
early
and
so
perfectly
sober
and
jocosely
asked
me
why
i
did
not
get
drunk
and
be
like
a
sailor
merely
smiling
i
retired
to
my
berth
thinking
it
was
very
queer
for
an
officer
to
laugh
at
a
boy
for
doing
right
and
feeling
happy
within
myself
because
i
had
escaped
temptation
by
and
by
three
other
boys
who
had
been
ashore
returned
in
a
state
which
a
sailor
would
call
three
sheets
in
the
wind
they
blustered
boasted
of
the
high
time
they
had
enjoyed
and
roundly
laughed
at
me
for
being
so
unlike
a
man-of-war’s-man
while
they
felt
as
big
as
any
man
on
board
the
next
morning
however
they
looked
rather
chop-fallen
when
the
captain
who
had
accidentally
seen
their
drunken
follies
on
shore
ordered
them
to
be
flogged
and
forbade
their
masters
to
send
them
ashore
while
we
remained
at
plymouth
now
then
it
was
pretty
evident
who
had
the
best
cruise
the
joke
was
on
the
other
side
for
while
their
drunken
behavior
cost
them
a
terrible
whipping
and
a
loss
of
liberty
my
temperance
gained
me
the
real
approbation
of
my
officers
and
more
liberty
than
ever
since
after
that
day
i
had
to
go
on
shore
to
do
errands
for
their
masters
as
well
as
for
my
own
the
young
sailor
may
learn
from
this
fact
the
benefit
of
temperance
and
the
folly
of
getting
drunk
for
the
sake
of
being
called
a
fine
fellow
my
frequent
visits
to
the
shore
gave
me
many
opportunities
to
run
away
while
my
dislike
of
everything
about
the
macedonian
inspired
me
with
the
disposition
to
improve
them
against
this
measure
my
judgment
wisely
remonstrated
and
happily
for
my
well
being
succeeded
such
an
attempt
would
inevitably
have
been
followed
by
my
recovery
since
a
handsome
bounty
was
paid
for
the
delivery
of
every
runaway
there
are
always
a
sufficient
number
to
be
found
who
will
engage
in
pursuit
for
the
sake
of
money--such
men
as
the
canadian
landlord
described
by
rev
wm
lighton
in
his
interesting
narrative,[6
a
work
with
which
no
doubt
most
of
my
readers
are
acquainted
since
it
has
enjoyed
an
immense
circulation
endurance
therefore
was
the
only
rational
purpose
i
could
form
perhaps
the
hope
of
a
speedy
discharge
through
my
mother’s
efforts
tended
somewhat
to
this
result
in
my
case
besides
my
situation
had
become
somewhat
more
tolerable
from
the
fact
that
by
dint
of
perseverance
in
a
civil
and
respectful
behavior
i
had
gained
the
good
will
both
of
the
officers
and
crew
yet
with
this
advantage
it
was
a
miserable
situation
there
are
few
worse
places
than
a
man
of
war
for
the
favorable
development
of
the
moral
character
in
a
boy
profanity
in
its
most
revolting
aspect
licentiousness
in
its
most
shameful
and
beastly
garb
vice
in
the
worst
of
its
proteus-like
shapes
abound
there
while
scarcely
a
moral
restraint
is
thrown
round
the
victim
the
meshes
of
temptation
are
spread
about
his
path
in
every
direction
bad
as
things
are
at
sea
they
are
worse
in
port
there
boat-loads
of
defiled
and
defiling
women
are
permitted
to
come
alongside
the
men
looking
over
the
side
select
whoever
best
pleases
his
lustful
fancy
and
by
paying
her
fare
he
is
allowed
to
take
and
keep
her
on
board
as
his
paramour
until
the
ship
is
once
more
ordered
to
sea
many
of
these
lost
unfortunate
creatures
are
in
the
springtime
of
life
some
of
them
are
not
without
pretensions
to
beauty
the
ports
of
plymouth
and
portsmouth
are
crowded
with
these
fallen
beings
how
can
a
boy
be
expected
to
escape
pollution
surrounded
by
such
works
of
darkness
yet
some
parents
send
their
children
to
sea
because
they
are
ungovernable
ashore
better
send
them
to
the
house
of
correction
there
is
one
aspect
in
which
life
at
sea
and
life
in
port
materially
differ
at
sea
a
sense
of
danger
an
idea
of
insecurity
is
ever
present
to
the
mind
in
harbor
a
sense
of
security
lulls
the
sailor
into
indulgence
he
feels
perfectly
safe
yet
even
in
harbor
danger
sometimes
visits
the
fated
ship
stealing
upon
her
like
the
spirit
of
evil
this
remark
was
fearfully
illustrated
in
the
loss
of
the
royal
george
which
sunk
at
spithead
near
portsmouth
on
the
29th
of
august
1782
this
splendid
line
of
battle
ship
of
one
hundred
and
eight
guns
had
arrived
at
spithead
needing
some
repairs
she
was
heeled
down
or
inclined
on
one
side
to
allow
the
workmen
to
work
on
her
sides
finding
more
needed
to
be
done
to
the
copper
sheathing
than
was
expected
the
sailors
were
induced
to
heel
her
too
much
while
in
this
state
she
was
struck
by
a
slight
squall
the
cannon
rolled
over
to
the
depressed
side
her
ports
were
open
she
filled
with
water
and
sunk
to
the
bottom
this
dreadful
catastrophe
occurred
about
ten
o’clock
in
the
morning
the
brave
admiral
kempenfeldt
was
writing
in
his
cabin
most
of
the
crew
together
with
some
three
hundred
women
were
between
decks

nearly
all
perished
captain
waghorn
her
commander
was
saved
his

one
of
her
lieutenants
was
lost
those
who
were
on
the
upper
deck
were
picked
up
by
the
boats
of
the
fleet
but
nearly
one
thousand
souls
met
with
a
sudden
and
untimely
end
the
poet
cowper
has
celebrated
this
melancholy
event
in
the
following
beautiful
lines
toll
for
the
brave
the
brave
that
are
no
more
all
sunk
beneath
the
wave
fast
by
their
native
shore
eight
hundred
of
the
brave
whose
courage
well
was
tried
had
made
the
vessel
heel
and
laid
her
on
her
side
a
land
breeze
shook
the
shrouds
and
she
was
overset

with
all
her
crew
complete

for
the

brave
kempenfeldt
is
gone
his
last
sea
fight
is
fought
his
work
of
glory
done
it
was
not

battle
no

gave
the
shock
she
sprang
no
fatal

she
ran

his

hundred
men

the
vessel
up

dreaded
by
our
foes
and
mingle
with
our
cup
the
tear
that
england
owes
her
timbers
yet
are
sound
and
she
may
float
again
full
charged
with
england’s
thunder
and

but
kempenfeldt
is
gone
his

he
and
his
eight
hundred
shall
plough
the
wave
no
more
to
return
to
my
narrative
our
ship
having
been
at
sea
two
years
needed
overhauling
she
was
therefore
taken
into
one
of
the
splendid
dry
docks
in
the
plymouth
dock-yard
while
the
crew
were
placed
for
the
time
being
on
board
an
old
hulk
a
week
or
two
sufficed
for
this
task
when
we
returned
to
our
old
quarters
she
looked
like
a
new
ship
having
been
gaily
painted
within
and
without
we
too
soon
got
newly
rigged
for
orders
had
reached
us
from
the
admiralty
office
to
prepare
for
sea
and
we
were
paid
off
most
of
the
men
laid
out
part
of
their
money
in
getting
new
clothing
some
of
it
went
to
buy
pictures
looking-glasses
crockery
ware
c
to
ornament
our
berths
so
that
they
bore
some
resemblance
to
a
cabin
the
women
were
ordered
ashore
and
we
were
once
more
ready
for
sea
the
practice
of
paying
seamen
at
long
intervals
is
the
source
of
many
evils
among
these
is
the
opportunity
given
to
pursers
to
practise
extortion
on
the
men--an
opportunity
they
are
not
slow
in
improving
the
spendthrift
habits
of
most
sailors
leave
them
with
a
barely
sufficient
quantity
of
clothing
for
present
purposes
when
they
ship
if
the
cruise
is
long
they
are
consequently
obliged
to
draw
from
the
purser
this
gentleman
is
ever
ready
to
supply
them
but
at
ruinous
prices
poor
articles
with
high
prices
are
to
be
found
in
his
hands
these
poor
jack
must
take
of
necessity
because
he
cannot
get
his
wages
until
he
is
paid
off
hence
what
with
poor
articles
high
charges
and
false
charges
the
purser
almost
always
has
a
claim
which
makes
jack’s
actual
receipts
for
two
or
three
years’
service
wofully
small
were
he
paid
at
stated
periods
he
could
make
his
own
purchases
as
he
needed
them
the
sailor
is
aware
of
this
evil
but
he
only
shows
his
apprehension
of
it
in
his
usually
good-humored
manner
if
he
sees
a
poor
ill-cut
garment
he
will
laugh
and
say
it
looks
like
a
purser’s
shirt
on
a
handspike
these
are
small
matters
but
they
go
to
make
up
the
sum
total
of
a
seaman’s
life
and
should
therefore
be
remedied
as
far
as
possible
our
preparations
all
completed
the
hoarse
voice
of
the
boatswain
rang
through
the
ship
crying
all
hands
up
anchor
ahoy
in
a
trice
the
capstan
bars
were
shipped
the
fifer
was
at
his
station
playing
a
lively
tune
the
boys
were
on
the
main
deck
holding
on
to
the
nippers
ready
to
pass
them
to
the
men
who
put
them
round
the
messenger
and
cable
then
amid
the
cries
of
walk
round
heave
away
my
lads
accompanied
by
the
shrill
music
of
the
fife
the
anchor
rose
from
its
bed
and
was
soon
dangling
under
our
bows
the
sails
were
then
shaken
out
the
ship
brought
before
the
wind
and
we
were
once
more
on
our
way
to
sea
we
were
directed
to
cruise
off
the
coast
of
france
this
time
where
as
we
were
then
at
war
with
the
french
we
were
likely
to
find
active
service
we
first
made
the
french
port
of
rochelle
from
thence
we
sailed
to
brest
which
was
closely
blockaded
by
a
large
british
fleet
consisting
of
one
three-decker
with
several
seventy-fours
besides
frigates
and
small
craft
we
joined
this
fleet
and
came
to
an
anchor
in
basque
roads
to
assist
in
the
blockade
our
first
object
was
to
bring
a
large
french
fleet
greatly
superior
to
us
in
size
and
numbers
to
an
engagement
with
all
our
manœuvring
we
could
not
succeed
in
enticing
them
from
their
snug
berth
in
the
harbor
of
brest
where
they
were
safely
moored
defended
by
a
heavy
fort
and
by
a
chain
crossing
the
harbor
to
prevent
the
ingress
of
any
force
that
might
be
bold
enough
to
attempt
to
cut
them
out
sometimes
we
sent
a
frigate
or
two
as
near
their
fort
as
they
dared
to
venture
in
order
to
entice
them
out
at
other
times
the
whole
fleet
would
get
under
weigh
and
stand
out
to
sea
but
without
success
the
frenchmen
were
either
afraid
we
had
a
larger
armament
than
was
visible
to
them
or
they
had
not
forgotten
the
splendid
victories
of
nelson
at
the
nile
and
trafalgar
whatever
they
thought
they
kept
their
ships
beyond
the
reach
of
our
guns
sometimes
however
their
frigates
would
creep
outside
the
forts
when
we
gave
them
chase
but
seldom
went
beyond
the
exchange
of
a
few
harmless
shots
this
was
what
our
men
called
boy’s
play
and
they
were
heartily
glad
when
we
were
ordered
to
return
to
plymouth
after
just
looking
into
plymouth
harbor
our
orders
were
countermanded
and
we
returned
to
the
coast
of
france
having
accomplished
about
one
half
the
distance
the
man
at
the
mast-head
cried
out
sail
ho
where
away
what
direction
responded
the
officer
of
the
deck
the
man
having
replied
the
officer
again
asked
what
does
she
look
like
she
looks
small
i
cannot
tell
sir
in
a
few
minutes
the
officer
hailed
again
by
shouting
mast-head
there
what
does
she
look
like
she
looks
like
a
small
sail-boat
sir
this
was
rather
a
novel
announcement
for
what
could
a
small
sail-boat
do
out
on
the
wide
ocean
but
a
few
minutes
convinced
us
that
it
was
even
so
for
from
the
deck
we
could
see
a
small
boat
with
only
a
man
and
a
boy
on
board
they
proved
to
be
two
french
prisoners
of
war
who
had
escaped
from
an
english
prison
and
having
stolen
a
small
boat
were
endeavoring
to
make
this
perilous
voyage
to
their
native
home
poor
fellows
they
looked
sadly
disappointed
at
finding
themselves
once
more
in
british
hands
they
had
already
been
in
prison
for
some
time
they
were
now
doomed
to
go
with
us
in
sight
of
their
own
sunny
france
and
then
be
torn
away
again
carried
to
england
and
imprisoned
until
the
close
of
the
war
no
wonder
they
looked
sorrowful
when
after
having
hazarded
life
for
home
and
liberty
they
found
both
snatched
from
them
in
a
moment
by
their
unlucky
rencontre
with
our
frigate
i
am
sure
we
should
all
have
been
glad
to
have
missed
them
but
this
is
only
one
of
the
consequences
of
war
having
joined
the
blockading
fleet
again
we
led
the
same
sort
of
life
as
before
now
at
anchor
then
giving
chase
now
standing
in
shore
and
anon
standing
out
to
sea
firing
and
being
fired
at
without
once
coming
into
action
determined
to
accomplish
some
exploit
or
other
our
captain
ordered
an
attempt
to
be
made
at
cutting
out
some
of
the
french
small
craft
that
lay
in
shore
we
were
accustomed
to
send
out
our
barges
almost
every
night
in
search
of
whatever
prey
they
might
capture
but
on
this
occasion
the
preparations
were
more
formidable
than
usual
the
oars
were
muffled
the
boat’s
crew
increased
and
every
man
was
armed
to
the
teeth
the
cots
were
got
ready
on
board
in
case
any
of
the
adventurers
should
return
wounded
cots
are
used
to
sleep
in
by
ward-room
officers
and
captains
midshipmen
and
sailors
using
hammocks
but
a
number
of
cots
are
always
kept
in
a
vessel
of
war
for
the
benefit
of
wounded
men
they
differ
from
a
hammock
in
being
square
at
the
bottom
and
consequently
more
easy
the
service
on
which
the
barge
was
sent
being
extremely
dangerous
the
cots
were
got
ready
to
receive
the
wounded
should
there
be
any
but
notwithstanding
these
expressive
preparations
the
brave
fellows
went
off
in
as
fine
spirits
as
if
they
had
been
going
on
shore
for
a
drunken
spree
such
is
the
contempt
of
danger
that
prevails
among
sailors
we
had
no
tidings
of
this
adventure
until
morning
when
i
was
startled
by
hearing
three
cheers
from
the
watch
on
deck
these
were
answered
by
three
more
from
a
party
that
seemed
approaching
us
i
ran
on
deck
just
as
our
men
came
alongside
with
their
bloodless
prize--a
lugger
laden
with
french
brandy
wine
and
castile
soap
they
had
made
this
capture
without
difficulty
for
the
crew
of
the
lugger
made
their
escape
in
a
boat
on
the
first
intimation
of
danger
as
this
was
our
first
prize
we
christened
her
the
young
macedonian
she
was
sent
to
the
admiral
but
what
became
of
her
i
never
heard
before
sending
her
away
however
the
officers
having
a
peculiar
itching
for
some
of
the
brandy
took
the
liberty
of
replenishing
their
empty
bottles
from
the
hold
this
with
true
aristocratic
liberality
they
kept
to
themselves
without
offering
the
smallest
portion
to
the
crew
some
of
them
showed
by
their
conduct
afterwards
that
this
brandy
possessed
considerable
strength
we
had
no
further
opportunity
to
signalize
either
ourselves
or
our
frigate
by
our
heroism
at
brest
for
we
were
soon
after
ordered
back
to
plymouth
where
for
a
short
time
we
lay
at
our
old
anchorage
ground
chapter
vi
at
plymouth
we
heard
some
vague
rumors
of
a
declaration
of
war
against
america
more
than
this
we
could
not
learn
since
the
utmost
care
was
taken
to
prevent
our
being
fully
informed
the
reason
of
this
secrecy
was
probably
because
we
had
several
americans
in
our
crew
most
of
whom
were
pressed
men
as
before
stated
these
men
had
they
been
certain
that
war
had
broken
out
would
have
given
themselves
up
as
prisoners
of
war
and
claimed
exemption
from
that
unjust
service
which
compelled
them
to
act
with
the
enemies
of
their
country
this
was
a
privilege
which
the
magnanimity
of
our
officers
ought
to
have
offered
them
they
had
already
perpetrated
a
grievous
wrong
upon
them
in
impressing
them
it
was
adding
cruelty
to
injustice
to
compel
their
service
in
a
war
against
their
own
nation
but
the
difficulty
with
naval
officers
is
that
they
do
not
treat
with
a
sailor
as
with
a
man
they
know
what
is
fitting
between
each
other
as
officers
but
they
treat
their
crews
on
another
principle
they
are
apt
to
look
at
them
as
pieces
of
living
mechanism
born
to
serve
to
obey
their
orders
and
administer
to
their
wishes
without
complaint
this
is
alike
a
bad
morality
and
a
bad
philosophy
there
is
often
more
real
manhood
in
the
forecastle
than
in
the
ward-room
and
until
the
common
sailor
is
treated
as
a
man
until
every
feeling
of
human
nature
is
conceded
to
him
in
naval
discipline--perfect
rational
subordination
will
never
be
attained
in
ships
of
war
or
in
merchant
vessels
it
is
needless
to
tell
of
the
intellectual
degradation
of
the
mass
of
seamen
a
man’s
a
man
for
a’
that
and
it
is
this
very
system
of
discipline
this
treating
them
as
automatons
which
keeps
them
degraded
when
will
human
nature
put
more
confidence
in
itself
leaving
plymouth
we
next
anchored
for
a
brief
space
at
torbay
a
small
port
in
the
british
channel
we
were
ordered
thence
to
convoy
a
huge
east
india
merchant
vessel
much
larger
than
our
frigate
and
having
five
hundred
troops
on
board
bound
to
the
east
indies
with
money
to
pay
the
troops
stationed
there
we
set
sail
in
a
tremendous
gale
of
wind
both
ships
stopped
two
days
at
madeira
to
take
in
wine
and
a
few
other
articles
after
leaving
this
island
we
kept
her
company
two
days
more
and
then
according
to
orders
having
wished
her
success
we
left
her
to
pursue
her
voyage
while
we
returned
to
finish
our
cruise
though
without
any
positive
information
we
now
felt
pretty
certain
that
our
government
was
at
war
with
america
among
other
things
our
captain
appeared
more
anxious
than
usual
he
was
on
deck
almost
all
the
time
the
look-out
aloft
was
more
rigidly
observed
and
every
little
while
the
cry
of
mast-head
there
arrested
our
attention
it
is
customary
in
men
of
war
to
keep
men
at
the
fore
and
main
mast-heads
whose
duty
it
is
to
give
notice
of
every
new
object
that
may
appear
they
are
stationed
on
the
royal
yards
if
they
are
up
but
if
not
on
the
top-gallant
yards
at
night
a
look-out
is
kept
on
the
fore-yard
only
thus
we
passed
several
days
the
captain
running
up
and
down
and
constantly
hailing
the
man
at
the
mast-head
early
in
the
morning
he
began
his
charge
to
keep
a
good
look-out
and
continued
to
repeat
it
until
night
indeed
he
seemed
almost
crazy
with
some
pressing
anxiety
the
men
felt
there
was
something
anticipated
of
which
they
were
ignorant
and
had
the
captain
heard
all
their
remarks
upon
his
conduct
he
would
not
have
felt
very
highly
flattered
still
everything
went
on
as
usual
the
day
was
spent
in
the
ordinary
duties
of
man-of-war
life
and
the
evening
in
telling
stories
of
things
most
rare
and
wonderful
for
your
genuine
old
tar
is
an
adept
in
spinning
yarns
and
some
of
them
in
respect
to
variety
and
length
might
safely
aspire
to
a
place
beside
the
great
magician
of
the
north
sir
walter
scott
or
any
of
those
prolific
heads
that
now
bring
forth
such
abundance
of
fiction
to
feed
a
greedy
public
who
read
as
eagerly
as
our
men
used
to
listen
to
this
yarn-spinning
was
added
the
most
humorous
singing
sometimes
dashed
with
a
streak
of
the
pathetic
which
i
assure
my
readers
was
most
touching
especially
one
very
plaintive
melody
with
a
chorus
beginning
with
now
if
our
ship
should
be
cast
away
it
would
be
our
lot
to
see
old
england
no
more
which
made
rather
a
melancholy
impression
on
my
boyish
mind
and
gave
rise
to
a
sort
of
presentiment
that
the
macedonian
would
never
return
home
again
a
presentiment
which
had
its
fulfilment
in
a
manner
totally
unexpected
to
us
all
the
presence
of
a
shark
for
several
days
with
its
attendant
pilot
fish
tended
to
strengthen
this
prevalent
idea
the
sabbath
came
and
it
brought
with
it
a
stiff
breeze
we
usually
made
a
sort
of
holiday
of
this
sacred
day
after
breakfast
it
was
common
to
muster
the
entire
crew
on
the
spar
deck
dressed
as
the
fancy
of
the
captain
might
dictate
sometimes
in
blue
jackets
and
white
trousers
or
blue
jackets
and
blue
trousers
at
other
times
in
blue
jackets
scarlet
vests
and
blue
or
white
trousers
with
our
bright
anchor
buttons
glancing
in
the
sun
and
our
black
glossy
hats
ornamented
with
black
ribbons
and
with
the
name
of
our
ship
painted
on
them
after
muster
we
frequently
had
church
service
read
by
the
captain
the
rest
of
the
day
was
devoted
to
idleness
but
we
were
destined
to
spend
the
sabbath
just
introduced
to
the
reader
in
a
very
different
manner
we
had
scarcely
finished
breakfast
before
the
man
at
the
mast-head
shouted
sail
ho
the
captain
rushed
upon
deck
exclaiming
mast-head
there
sir
where
away
is
the
sail
the
precise
answer
to
this
question
i
do
not
recollect
but
the
captain
proceeded
to
ask
what
does
she
look
like
a
square-rigged
vessel
sir
was
the
reply
of
the
look-out
after
a
few
minutes
the
captain
shouted
again
mast-head
there
sir
what
does
she
look
like
a
large
ship
sir
standing
toward
us
by
this
time
most
of
the
crew
were
on
deck
eagerly
straining
their
eyes
to
obtain
a
glimpse
of
the
approaching
ship
and
murmuring
their
opinions
to
each
other
on
her
probable
character
then
came
the
voice
of
the
captain
shouting
keep
silence
fore
and
aft
silence
being
secured
he
hailed
the
look-out
who
to
his
question
of
what
does
she
look
like
replied
a
large
frigate
bearing
down
upon
us
sir
a
whisper
ran
along
the
crew
that
the
stranger
ship
was
a
yankee
frigate
the
thought
was
confirmed
by
the
command
of
all
hands
clear
the
ship
for
action
ahoy
the
drum
and
fife
beat
to
quarters
bulk-heads
were
knocked
away
the
guns
were
released
from
their
confinement
the
whole
dread
paraphernalia
of
battle
was
produced
and
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
minutes
of
hurry
and
confusion
every
man
and
boy
was
at
his
post
ready
to
do
his
best
service
for
his
country
except
the
band
who
claiming
exemption
from
the
affray
safely
stowed
themselves
away
in
the
cable
tier
we
had
only
one
sick
man[7
on
the
list
and
he
at
the
cry
of
battle
hurried
from
his
cot
feeble
as
he
was
to
take
his
post
of
danger
a
few
of
the
junior
midshipmen
were
stationed
below
on
the
berth
deck
with
orders
given
in
our
hearing
to
shoot
any
man
who
attempted
to
run
from
his
quarters
our
men
were
all
in
good
spirits
though
they
did
not
scruple
to
express
the
wish
that
the
coming
foe
was
a
frenchman
rather
than
a
yankee
we
had
been
told
by
the
americans
on
board
that
frigates
in
the
american
service
carried
more
and
heavier
metal
than
ours
this
together
with
our
consciousness
of
superiority
over
the
french
at
sea
led
us
to
a
preference
for
a
french
antagonist
the
americans
among
our
number
felt
quite
disconcerted
at
the
necessity
which
compelled
them
to
fight
against
their
own
countrymen
one
of
them
named
john
card
as
brave
a
seaman
as
ever
trod
a
plank
ventured
to
present
himself
to
the
captain
as
a
prisoner
frankly
declaring
his
objections
to
fight
that
officer
very
ungenerously
ordered
him
to
his
quarters
threatening
to
shoot
him
if
he
made
the
request
again
poor
fellow
he
obeyed
the
unjust
command
and
was
killed
by
a
shot
from
his
own
countrymen
this
fact
is
more
disgraceful
to
the
captain
of
the
macedonian
than
even
the
loss
of
his
ship
it
was
a
gross
and
a
palpable
violation
of
the
rights
of
man
as
the
approaching
ship
showed
american
colors
all
doubt
of
her
character
was
at
an
end
we
must
fight
her
was
the
conviction
of
every
breast
every
possible
arrangement
that
could
insure
success
was
accordingly
made
the
guns
were
shotted
the
matches
lighted
for
although
our
guns
were
all
furnished
with
first-rate
locks
they
were
also
provided
with
matches
attached
by
lanyards
in
case
the
lock
should
miss
fire
a
lieutenant
then
passed
through
the
ship
directing
the
marines
and
boarders
who
were
furnished
with
pikes
cutlasses
and
pistols
how
to
proceed
if
it
should
be
necessary
to
board
the
enemy
he
was
followed
by
the
captain
who
extorted
the
men
to
fidelity
and
courage
urging
upon
their
consideration
the
well-known
motto
of
the
brave
nelson
england
expects
every
man
to
do
his
duty
in
addition
to
all
these
preparations
on
deck
some
men
were
stationed
in
the
tops
with
small-arms
whose
duty
it
was
to
attend
to
trimming
the
sails
and
to
use
their
muskets
provided
we
came
to
close
action
there
were
others
also
below
called
sail
trimmers
to
assist
in
working
the
ship

it
be
necessary
to
shift
her
position

the
battle

station
was
at
the
fifth
gun
on
the
main
deck
it
was
my
duty
to
supply
my
gun
with
powder
a
boy
being
appointed
to
each
gun
in
the
ship
on
the
side
we
engaged
for
this
purpose
a
woollen
screen
was
placed
before
the
entrance
to
the
magazine
with
a
hole
in
it
through
which
the
cartridges
were
passed
to
the
boys
we
received
them
there
and
covering
them
with
our
jackets
hurried
to
our
respective
guns
these
precautions
are
observed
to
prevent
the
powder
taking
fire
before
it
reaches
the
gun
thus
we
all
stood
awaiting
orders
in
motionless
suspense
at
last
we
fired
three
guns
from
the
larboard
side
of
the
main
deck
this
was
followed
by
the
command
cease
firing
you
are
throwing
away
your
shot
then
came
the
order
to
wear
ship
and
prepare
to
attack
the
enemy
with
our
starboard
guns
soon
after
this
i
heard
a
firing
from
some
other
quarter
which
i
at
first
supposed
to
be
a
discharge
from
our
quarter
deck
guns
though
it
proved
to
be
the
roar
of
the
enemy’s
cannon
a
strange
noise
such
as
i
had
never
heard
before
next
arrested
my
attention
it
sounded
like
the
tearing
of
sails
just
over
our
heads
this
i
soon
ascertained
to
be
the
wind
of
the
enemy’s
shot
the
firing
after
a
few
minutes’
cessation
recommenced
the
roaring
of
cannon
could
now
be
heard
from
all
parts
of
our
trembling
ship
and
mingling
as
it
did
with
that
of
our
foes
it
made
a
most
hideous
noise
by-and-by
i
heard
the
shot
strike
the
sides
of
our
ship
the
whole
scene
grew
indescribably
confused
and
horrible
it
was
like
some
awfully
tremendous
thunder-storm
whose
deafening
roar
is
attended
by
incessant
streaks
of
lightning
carrying
death
in
every
flash
and
strewing
the
ground
with
the
victims
of
its
wrath
only
in
our
case
the
scene
was
rendered
more
horrible
than
that
by
the
presence
of
torrents
of
blood
which
dyed
our
decks
though
the
recital
may
be
painful
yet
as
it
will
reveal
the
horrors
of
war
and
show
at
what
a
fearful
price
a
victory
is
won
or
lost
i
will
present
the
reader
with
things
as
they
met
my
eye
during
the
progress
of
this
dreadful
fight
i
was
busily
supplying
my
gun
with
powder
when
i
saw
blood
suddenly
fly
from
the
arm
of
a
man
stationed
at
our
gun
i
saw
nothing
strike
him
the
effect
alone
was
visible
in
an
instant
the
third
lieutenant
tied
his
handkerchief
round
the
wounded
arm
and
sent
the
groaning
wretch
below
to
the
surgeon
the
cries
of
the
wounded
now
rang
through
all
parts
of
the
ship
these
were
carried
to
the
cockpit
as
fast
as
they
fell
while
those
more
fortunate
men
who
were
killed
outright
were
immediately
thrown
overboard
as
i
was
stationed
but
a
short
distance
from
the
main
hatchway
i
could
catch
a
glance
at
all
who
were
carried
below
a
glance
was
all
i
could
indulge
in
for
the
boys
belonging
to
the
guns
next
to
mine
were
wounded
in
the
early
part
of
the
action
and
i
had
to
spring
with
all
my
might
to
keep
three
or
four
guns
supplied
with
cartridges
i
saw
two
of
these
lads
fall
nearly
together
one
of
them
was
struck
in
the
leg
by
a
large
shot
he
had
to
suffer
amputation
above
the
wound
the
other
had
a
grape
or
canister
shot
sent
through
his
ankle
a
stout
yorkshireman
lifted
him
in
his
arms
and
hurried
him
to
the
cockpit
he
had
his
foot
cut
off
and
was
thus
made
lame
for
life
two
of
the
boys
stationed
on
the
quarter
deck
were
killed
they
were
both
portuguese
a
man
who
saw
one
of
them
killed
afterwards
told
me
that
his
powder
caught
fire
and
burnt
the
flesh
almost
off
his
face
in
this
pitiable
situation
the
agonized
boy
lifted
up
both
hands
as
if
imploring
relief
when
a
passing
shot
instantly
cut
him
in
two
i
was
an
eye-witness
to
a
sight
equally
revolting
a
man
named
aldrich
had
one
of
his
hands
cut
off
by
a
shot
and
almost
at
the
same
moment
he
received
another
shot
which
tore
open
his
bowels
in
a
terrible
manner
as
he
fell
two
or
three
men
caught
him
in
their
arms
and
as
he
could
not
live
threw
him
overboard
one
of
the
officers
in
my
division
also
fell
in
my
sight
he
was
a
noble-hearted
fellow
named
nan
kivell.[8
a
grape
or
canister
shot
struck
him
near
the
heart
exclaiming
oh
my
god
he
fell
and
was
carried
below
where
he
shortly
after
died
mr
hope
our
first
lieutenant
was
also
slightly
wounded
by
a
grummet
or
small
iron
ring
probably
torn
from
a
hammock
clew
by
a
shot
he
went
below
shouting
to
the
men
to
fight
on
having
had
his
wound
dressed
he
came
up
again
shouting
to
us
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
bidding
us
fight
with
all
our
might
there
was
not
a
man
in
the
ship
but
would
have
rejoiced
had
he
been
in
the
place
of
our
master’s
mate
the
unfortunate
nan
kivell
the
battle
went
on
our
men
kept
cheering
with
all
their
might
i
cheered
with
them
though
i
confess
i
scarcely
knew
for
what
certainly
there
was
nothing
very
inspiriting
in
the
aspect
of
things
where
i
was
stationed
so
terrible
had
been
the
work
of
destruction
round
us
it
was
termed
the
slaughter-house
not
only
had
we
had
several
boys
and
men
killed
or
wounded
but
several
of
the
guns
were
disabled
the
one
i
belonged
to
had
a
piece
of
the
muzzle
knocked
out
and
when
the
ship
rolled
it
struck
a
beam
of
the
upper
deck
with
such
force
as
to
become
jammed
and
fixed
in
that
position
a
twenty-four
pound
shot
had
also
passed
through
the
screen
of
the
magazine
immediately
over
the
orifice
through
which
we
passed
our
powder
the
schoolmaster[9
received
a
death
wound
the
brave
boatswain
who
came
from
the
sick
bay
to
the
din
of
battle
was
fastening
a
stopper
on
a
back-stay
which
had
been
shot
away
when
his
head
was
smashed
to
pieces
by
a
cannon-ball
another
man
going
to
complete
the
unfinished
task
was
also
struck
down
another
of
our
midshipmen
also
received
a
severe
wound
the
unfortunate
ward-room
steward
who
the
reader
will
recollect
attempted
to
cut
his
throat
on
a
former
occasion
was
killed
a
fellow
named
john
who
for
some
petty
offence
had
been
sent
on
board
as
a
punishment
was
carried
past
me
wounded
i
distinctly
heard
the
large
blood-drops
fall
pat
pat
pat
on
the
deck
his
wounds
were
mortal
even
a
poor
goat
kept
by
the
officers
for
her
milk
did
not
escape
the
general
carnage
her
hind
legs
were
shot
off
and
poor
nan
was
thrown
overboard
such
was
the
terrible
scene
amid
which
we
kept
on
our
shouting
and
firing
our
men
fought
like
tigers
some
of
them
pulled
off
their
jackets
others
their
jackets
and
vests
while
some
still
more
determined
had
taken
off
their
shirts
and
with
nothing
but
a
handkerchief
tied
round
the
waistbands
of
their
trousers
fought
like
heroes
jack
sadler
whom
the
reader
will
recollect
was
one
of
these
i
also
observed
a
boy
named
cooper
stationed
at
a
gun
some
distance
from
the
magazine
he
came
to
and
fro
on
the
full
run
and
appeared
to
be
as
merry
as
a
cricket
the
third
lieutenant
cheered
him
along
occasionally
by
saying
well
done
my
boy
you
are
worth
your
weight
in
gold
i
have
often
been
asked
what
were
my
feelings
during
this
fight
i
felt
pretty
much
as
i
suppose
every
one
does
at
such
a
time
that
men
are
without
thought
when
they
stand
amid
the
dying
and
the
dead
is
too
absurd
an
idea
to
be
entertained
a
moment
we
all
appeared
cheerful
but
i
know
that
many
a
serious
thought
ran
through
my
mind
still
what
could
we
do
but
keep
up
a
semblance
at
least
of
animation
to
run
from
our
quarters
would
have
been
certain
death
from
the
hands
of
our
own
officers
to
give
way
to
gloom
or
to
show
fear
would
do
no
good
and
might
brand
us
with
the
name
of
cowards
and
ensure
certain
defeat
our
only
true
philosophy
therefore
was
to
make
the
best
of
our
situation
by
fighting
bravely
and
cheerfully
i
thought
a
great
deal
however
of
the
other
world
every
groan
every
falling
man
told
me
that
the
next
instant
i
might
be
before
the
judge
of
all
the
earth
for
this
i
felt
unprepared
but
being
without
any
particular
knowledge
of
religious
truth
i
satisfied
myself
by
repeating
again
and
again
the
lord’s
prayer
and
promising
that
if
spared
i
would
be
more
attentive
to
religious
duties
than
ever
before
this
promise
i
had
no
doubt
at
the
time
of
keeping
but
i
have
learned
since
that
it
is
easier
to
make
promises
amidst
the
roar
of
the
battle’s
thunder
or
in
the
horrors
of
shipwreck
than
to
keep
them
when
danger
is
absent
and
safety
smiles
upon
our
path
while
these
thoughts
secretly
agitated
my
bosom
the
din
of
battle
continued
grape
and
canister
shot
were
pouring
through
our
port-holes
like
leaden
rain
carrying
death
in
their
trail
the
large
shot
came
against
the
ship’s
side
like
iron
hail
shaking
her
to
the
very
keel
or
passing
through
her
timbers
and
scattering
terrific
splinters
which
did
a
more
appalling
work
than
even
their
own
death-giving
blows
the
reader
may
form
an
idea
of
the
effect
of
grape
and
canister
when
he
is
told
that
grape
shot
is
formed
by
seven
or
eight
balls
confined
to
an
iron
and
tied
in
a
cloth
these
balls
are
scattered
by
the
explosion
of
the
powder
canister
shot
is
made
by
filling
a
powder
canister
with
balls
each
as
large
as
two
or
three
musket
balls
these
also
scatter
with
direful
effect
when
discharged
what
then
with
splinters
cannon
balls
grape
and
canister
poured
incessantly
upon
us
the
reader
may
be
assured
that
the
work
of
death
went
on
in
a
manner
which
must
have
been
satisfactory
even
to
the
king
of
terrors
himself
suddenly
the
rattling
of
the
iron
hail
ceased
we
were
ordered
to
cease
firing
a
profound
silence
ensued
broken
only
by
the
stifled
groans
of
the
brave
sufferers
below
it
was
soon
ascertained
that
the
enemy
had
shot
ahead
to
repair
damages
for
she
was
not
so
disabled
but
she
could
sail
without
difficulty
while
we
were
so
cut
up
that
we
lay
utterly
helpless
our
head
braces
were
shot
away
the
fore
and
main
top-masts
were
gone
the
mizzen
mast
hung
over
the
stern
having
carried
several
men
over
in
its
fall
we
were
in
the
state
of
a
complete
wreck
a
council
was
now
held
among
the
officers
on
the
quarter
deck
our
condition
was
perilous
in
the
extreme
victory
or
escape
was
alike
hopeless
our
ship
was
disabled
many
of
our
men
were
killed
and
many
more
wounded
the
enemy
would
without
doubt
bear
down
upon
us
in
a
few
moments
and
as
she
could
now
choose
her
own
position
would
without
doubt
rake
us
fore
and
aft
any
further
resistance
was
therefore
folly
so
in
spite
of
the
hot-brained
lieutenant
mr
hope
who
advised
them
not
to
strike
but
to
sink
alongside
it
was
determined
to
strike
our
bunting.[10
this
was
done
by
the
hands
of
a
brave
fellow
named
watson
whose
saddened
brow
told
how
severely
it
pained
his
lion
heart
to
do
it
to
me
it
was
a
pleasing
sight
for
i
had
seen
fighting
enough
for
one
sabbath
more
than
i
wished
to
see
again
on
a
week
day
his
britannic
majesty’s
frigate
macedonian
was
now
the
prize
of
the
american
frigate
united
states
before
detailing
the
subsequent
occurrences
in
my
history
i
will
present
the
curious
reader
with
a
copy
of
captain
carden’s
letter
to
the
government
describing
this
action
it
will
serve
to

sir
it
is
with
the
deepest
regret
i
have
to
acquaint
you
for
the
information
of
my
lords
commissioners
of
the
admiralty
that
his
majesty’s
late
ship
macedonian
was
captured
on
the
25th
instant
by
the
united
states
ship
united

commodore
decatur
commander
the
detail
is
as
follows
a
short
time
after
daylight
steering
n
w
by
w
with
the
wind
from
the
southward
in
latitude
29°
n
and
longitude
29°
30′
w
in
the
execution
of
their
lordships’
orders
a
sail
was
seen
on
the
lee
beam
which
i
immediately
stood
for
and
made
her
out
to
be
a
large
frigate
under
american
colors
at
nine
o’clock
i
closed
with
her
and
she
commenced
the
action
which
we
returned
but
from
the
enemy
keeping
two
points
off
the
wind
i
was
not
enabled
to
get
as
close
to
her
as
i
could
have
wished
after
an
hour’s
action
the
enemy
backed
and
came
to
the
wind
and
i
was
then
enabled
to
bring
her
to
close
battle
in
this
situation
i
soon
found
the
enemy’s
force
too
superior
to
expect
success
unless
some
very
fortunate
chance
occurred
in
our
favor
and
with
this
hope
i
continued
the
battle
to
two
hours
and
ten
minutes
when
having
the
mizzen
mast
shot
away
by
the
board
topmasts
shot
away
by
the
caps
main
yard
shot
in
pieces
lower
masts
badly
wounded
lower
rigging
all
cut
to
pieces
a
small
proportion
only
of
the
fore-sail
left
to
the
fore-yard
all
the
guns
on
the
quarter
deck
and
forecastle
disabled
but
two
and
filled
with
wreck
two
also
on
the
main
deck
disabled
and
several
shot
between
wind
and
water
a
very
great
proportion
of
the
crew
killed
and
wounded
and
the
enemy
comparatively
in
good
order
who
had
now
shot
ahead
and
was
about
to
place
himself
in
a
raking
position
without
our
being
enabled
to
return
the
fire
being
a
perfect
wreck
and
unmanageable
log
i
deemed
it
prudent
though
a
painful
extremity
to
surrender
his
majesty’s
ship
nor
was
this
dreadful
alternative
resorted
to
till
every
hope
of
success
was
removed
even
beyond
the
reach
of
chance
nor
till
i
trust
their
lordships
will
be
aware
every
effort
had
been
made
against
the
enemy
by
myself
and
my
brave
officers
and
men
nor
should
she
have
been
surrendered
whilst
a
man
lived
on
board
had
she
been
manageable
i
am
sorry
to
say
our
loss
is
very
severe
i
find
by
this
day’s
muster
thirty-six
killed
three
of
whom
lingered
a
short
time
after
the
battle
thirty-six
severely
wounded
many
of
whom
cannot
recover
and
thirty-two
slightly
wounded
who
may
all
do
well
total
one
hundred
and
four
the
truly
noble
and
animating
conduct
of
my
officers
and
the
steady
bravery
of
my
crew
to
the
last
moment
of
the
battle
must
ever
render
them
dear
to
their
country
my
first
lieutenant
david
hope
was
severely
wounded
in
the
head
towards
the
close
of
the
battle
and
taken
below
but
was
soon
again
on
deck
displaying
that
greatness
of
mind
and
exertion
which
though
it
may
be
equalled
can
never
be
excelled
the
third
lieutenant
john
bulford
was
also
wounded
but
not
obliged
to
quit
his
quarters
second
lieutenant
samuel
mottley
and
he
deserves
my
highest
acknowledgments
the
cool
and
steady
conduct
of
mr
walker
the
master
was
very
great
during
the
battle
as
also
that
of
lieutenants
wilson
and
magill
of
the
marines
on
being
taken
on
board
the
enemy’s
ship

ceased
to
wonder
at
the
result

chapter
vii
i
now
went
below
to
see
how
matters
appeared
there
the
first
object
i
met
was
a
man
bearing
a
limb
which
had
just
been
detached
from
some
suffering
wretch
pursuing
my
way
to
the
ward-room
i
necessarily
passed
through
the
steerage
which
was
strewed
with
the
wounded
it
was
a
sad
spectacle
made
more
appalling
by
the
groans
and
cries
which
rent
the
air
some
were
groaning
others
were
swearing
most
bitterly
a
few
were
praying
while
those
last
arrived
were
begging
most
piteously
to
have
their
wounds
dressed
next
the
surgeon
and
his
mate
were
smeared
with
blood
from
head
to
foot
they
looked
more
like
butchers
than
doctors
having
so
many
patients
they
had
once
shifted
their
quarters
from
the
cockpit
to
the
steerage
they
now
removed
to
the
ward-room
and
the
long
table
round
which
the
officers
had
sat
over
many
a
merry
feast
was
soon
covered
with
the
bleeding
forms
of
maimed
and
mutilated
seamen.[11
while
looking
round
the
ward-room
i
heard
a
noise
above
occasioned
by
the
arrival
of
the
boats
from
the
conquering
frigate
very
soon
a
lieutenant
i
think
his
name
was
nicholson,[12
came
into
the
ward-room
and
said
to
the
busy
surgeon
how
do
you
do
doctor
i
have
enough
to
do
replied
he
shaking
his
head
thoughtfully
you
have
made
wretched
work
for
us
these
officers
were
not
strangers
to
each
other
for
the
reader
will
recollect
that
the
commanders
and
officers
of
these
two
frigates
had
exchanged
visits
when
we
were
lying
at
norfolk
some
months
before
i
now
set
to
work
to
render
all
the
aid
in
my
power
to
the
sufferers
our
carpenter
named
reed
had
his
leg
cut
off
i
helped
to
carry
him
to
the
after
ward-room
but
he
soon
breathed
out
his
life
there
and
then
i
assisted
in
throwing
his
mangled
remains
overboard
we
got
out
the
cots
as
fast
as
possible
for
most
of
them
were
stretched
out
on
the
gory
deck
one
poor
fellow
who
lay
with
a
broken
thigh
begged
me
to
give
him
water
i
gave
him
some
he
looked
unutterable
gratitude
drank
and
died
it
was
with
exceeding
difficulty
i
moved
through
the
steerage
it
was
so
covered
with
mangled
men
and
so
slippery
with
streams
of
blood
there
was
a
poor
boy
there
crying
as
if
his
heart
would
break
he
had
been
servant
to
the
bold
boatswain
whose
head
was
dashed
to
pieces
poor
boy
he
felt
that
he
had
lost
a
friend
i
tried
to
comfort
him
by
reminding
him
that
he
ought
to
be
thankful
for
having
escaped
death
himself
here
also
i
met
one
of
my
messmates
who
showed
the
utmost
joy
at
seeing
me
alive
for
he
said
he
had
heard
that
i
was
killed
he
was
looking
up
his
messmates
which
he
said
was
always
done
by
sailors
we
found
two
of
our
mess
wounded
one
was
the
swede
logholm
who
fell
overboard
as
mentioned
in
a
former
chapter
and
was
nearly
lost
we
held
him
while
the
surgeon
cut
off
his
leg
above
the
knee
the
task
was
most
painful
to
behold
the
surgeon
using
his
knife
and
saw
on
human
flesh
and
bones
as
freely
as
the
butcher
at
the
shambles
does
on
the
carcass
of
the
beast
our
other
messmate
suffered
still
more
than
the
swede
he
was
sadly
mutilated
about
the
legs
and
thighs
with
splinters
such
scenes
of
suffering
as
i
saw
in
that
ward-room
i
hope
never
to
witness
again
could
the
civilized
world
behold
them
as
they
were
and
as
they
often
are
infinitely
worse
than
on
that
occasion
it
seems
to
me
they
would
forever
put
down
the
barbarous
practices
of
war
by
universal
consent
most
of
our
officers
and
men
were
taken
on
board
the
victor
ship
i
was
left
with
a
few
others
to
take
care
of
the
wounded
my
master
the
sailing-master
was
also
among
the
officers
who
continued
in
their
ship
most
of
the
men
who
remained
were
unfit
for
any
service
having
broken
into
the
spirit-room
and
made
themselves
drunk
some
of
them
broke
into
the
purser’s
room
and
helped
themselves
to
clothing
while
others
by
previous
agreement
took
possession
of
their
dead
messmates’
property
for
my
own
part
i
was
content
to
help
myself
to
a
little
of
the
officers’
provisions
which
did
me
more
good
than
could
be
obtained
from
rum
what
was
worse
than
all
however
was
the
folly
of
the
sailors
in
giving
spirit
to
their
wounded
messmates
since
it
only
served
to
aggravate
their
distress
among
the
wounded
was
a
brave
fellow
named
wells
after
the
surgeon
had
amputated
and
dressed
his
arm
he
walked
about
in
fine
spirits
as
if
he
had
received
only
a
slight
injury
indeed
while
under
the
operation
he
manifested
a
similar
heroism--observing
to
the
surgeon
i
have
lost
my
arm
in
the
service
of
my
country
but
i
don’t
mind
it
doctor
it’s
the
fortune
of
war
cheerful
and
gay
as
he
was
he
soon
died
his
companions
gave
him
rum
he
was
attacked
by
fever
and
died
thus
his
messmates
actually
killed
him
with
kindness
we
had
all
sorts
of
dispositions
and
temperaments
among
our
crew
to
me
it
was
a
matter
of
great
interest
to
watch
their
various
manifestations
some
who
had
lost
their
messmates
appeared
to
care
nothing
about
it
while
others
were
grieving
with
all
the
tenderness
of
women
of
these
was
the
survivor
of
two
seamen
who
had
formerly
been
soldiers
in
the
same
regiment
he
bemoaned
the
loss
of
his
comrade
with
expressions
of
profoundest
grief
there
were
also
two
boatswain’s
mates
named
adams
and
brown
who
had
been
messmates
for
several
years
in
the
same
ship
brown
was
killed
or
so
wounded
that
he
died
soon
after
the
battle
it
was
really
a
touching
spectacle
to
see
the
rough
hardy
features
of
the
brave
old
sailor
streaming
with
tears
as
he
picked
out
the
dead
body
of
his
friend
from
among
the
wounded
and
gently
carried
it
to
the
ship’s
side
saying
to
the
inanimate
form
he
bore
o
bill
we
have
sailed
together
in
a
number
of
ships
we
have
been
in
many
gales
and
some
battles
but
this
is
the
worst
day
i
have
seen
we
must
now
part
here
he
dropped
the
body
into
the
deep
and
then
a
fresh
torrent
of
tears
streaming
over
his
weather-beaten
face
he
added
i
can
do
no
more
for
you
farewell
god
be
with
you
here
was
an
instance
of
genuine
friendship
worth
more
than
the
heartless
professions
of
thousands
who
in
the
fancied
superiority
of
their
elevated
position
in
the
social
circle
will
deign
nothing
but
a
silly
sneer
at
this
record
of
a
sailor’s
grief
the
circumstance
was
rather
a
singular
one
that
in
both
the
contending
frigates
the
second
boatswain’s
mate
bore
the
name
of
william
brown
and
that
they
both
were
killed
yet
such
was
the
fact
the
great
number
of
the
wounded
kept
our
surgeon
and
his
mate
busily
employed
at
their
horrid
work
until
late
at
night
and
it
was
a
long
time
before
they
had
much
leisure
i
remember
passing
round
the
ship
the
day
after
the
battle
coming
to
a
hammock
i
found
some
one
in
it
apparently
asleep
i
spoke
he
made
no
answer
i
looked
into
the
hammock
he
was
dead
my
messmates
coming
up
we
threw
the
corpse
overboard
that
was
no
time
for
useless
ceremony
the
man
had
probably
crawled
to
his
hammock
the
day
before
and
not
being
perceived
in
the
general
distress
bled
to
death
o
war
who
can
reveal
thy
miseries
when
the
crew
of
the
united
states
first
boarded
our
frigate
to
take
possession
of
her
as
their
prize
our
men
heated
with
the
fury
of
the
battle
exasperated
with
the
sight
of
their
dead
and
wounded
shipmates
and
rendered
furious
by
the
rum
they
had
obtained
from
the
spirit-room
felt
and
exhibited
some
disposition
to
fight
their
captors
but
after
the
confusion
had
subsided
and
part
of
our
men
were
snugly
stowed
away
in
the
american
ship
and
the
remainder
found
themselves
kindly
used
in
their
own
the
utmost
good
feeling
began
to
prevail
we
took
hold
and
cleansed
the
ship
using
hot
vinegar
to
take
out
the
scent
of
the
blood
that
had
dyed
the
white
of
our
planks
with
crimson
we
also
took
hold
and
aided
in
fitting
our
disabled
frigate
for
her
voyage
this
being
accomplished
both
ships
sailed
in
company
toward
the
american
coast
i
soon
felt
myself
perfectly
at
home
with
the
american
seamen
so
much
so
that
i
chose
to
mess
with
them
my
shipmates
also
participated
in
similar
feelings
in
both
ships
all
idea
that
we
had
been
trying
to
shoot
out
each
other’s
brains
so
shortly
before
seemed
forgotten
we
ate
together
drank
together
joked
sung
laughed
told
yarns
in
short
a
perfect
union
of
ideas
feelings
and
purposes
seemed
to
exist
among
all
hands
a
corresponding
state
of
unanimity
existed
i
was
told
among
the
officers
commodore
decatur
showed
himself
to
be
a
gentleman
as
well
as
a
hero
in
his
treatment
of
the
officers
of
the
macedonian
when
captain
carden
offered
his
sword
to
the
commodore
remarking
as
he
did
so
i
am
an
undone
man
i
am
the
first
british
naval
officer
that
has
struck
his
flag
to
an
american
the
noble
commodore
either
refused
to
receive
the
sword
or
immediately
returned
it
smiling
as
he
said
you
are
mistaken
sir
your
guerrière
has
been
taken
by
us
and
the
flag
of
a
frigate[13
was
struck
before
yours
this
somewhat
revived
the
spirits
of
the
old
captain
but
no
doubt
he
still
felt
his
soul
stung
with
shame
and
mortification
at
the
loss
of
his
ship
participating
as
he
did
in
the
haughty
spirit
of
the
british
aristocracy
it
was
natural
for
him
to
feel
galled
and
wounded
to
the
quick
in
the
position
of
a
conquered
man
we
were
now
making
the
best
of
our
way
to
america
notwithstanding
the
patched-up
condition
of
the
macedonian_,[14
she
was
far
superior
in
a
sailing
capacity
to
her
conqueror
the
united
states
had
always
been
a
dull
sailer
and
had
been
christened
by
the
name
of
the
old
wagon
whenever
a
boat
came
alongside
of
our
frigate
and
the
boatswain’s
mate
was
ordered
to
pipe
away
the
boat’s
crew
he
used
to
sound
his
shrill
call
on
the
whistle
and
bawl
out
away
wagoners
away
instead
of
away
united
states
men
away
this
piece
of
pleasantry
used
to
be
rebuked
by
the
officers
but
in
a
manner
that
showed
they
enjoyed
the
joke
they
usually
replied
boatswain’s
mate
you
rascal
pipe
away
united
states
men
not
wagoners
we
have
no
wagoners
on
board
of
a
ship
still
in
spite
of
rebuke
the
joke
went
on
until
it
grew
stale
by
repetition
one
thing
was
made
certain
however
by
the
sailing
qualities
of
the
macedonian
which
was
that
if
we
had
been
disposed
to
escape
from
our
foe
before
the
action
we
could
have
done
so
with
all
imaginable
ease
this
however
would
have
justly
exposed
us
to
disgrace
while
our
capture
did
not
there
was
every
reason
why
the
united
states
should
beat
us
she
was
larger
in
size
heavier
in
metal
more
numerous
in
men
and
stronger
built
than
the
macedonian
another
fact
in
her
favor
was
that
our
captain
at
first
mistook
her
for
the
essex
which
carried
short
carronades
hence
he
engaged
her
at
long
shot
at
first
for
as
we
had
the
weather
gage
we
could
take
what
position
we
pleased
but
this
manœuvre
only
wasted
our
shot
and
gave
her
the
advantage
as
she
actually
carried
larger
metal
than
we
did
when
we
came
to
close
action
the
shot
from
the
united
states
went
through
and
through
our
ship
while
ours
struck
her
sides
and
fell
harmlessly
into
the
water
this
is
to
be
accounted
for
both
by
the
superiority
of
the
metal
and
of
the
ship
her
guns
were
heavier
and
her
sides
thicker
than
ours
some
have
said
that
her
sides
were
stuffed
with
cork
of
this
however
i
am
not
certain
her
superiority
both
in
number
of
men
and
guns
may
easily
be
seen
by
the
following
statistics
we
carried
forty-nine
guns
long
eighteen-pounders
on
the
main
deck
and
thirty-two
pound
carronades
on
the
quarter
deck
and
forecastle
our
whole
number
of
hands
including
officers
men
and
boys
was
three
hundred
the
united
states
carried
four
hundred
and
fifty
men
and
fifty-four
guns
long
twenty-four
pounders
on
the
main
deck
and
forty-two
pound
carronades
on
the
quarter
deck
and
forecastle
so
that
in
actual
force
she
was
immensely
our
superior
to
these
should
be
added
the
consideration
that
the
men
in
the
two
ships
fought
under
the
influence
of
different
motives
many
of
our
hands
were
in
the
service
against
their
will
some
of
them
were
americans
wrongfully
impressed
and
inwardly
hoping
for
defeat
while
nearly
every
man
in
our
ship
sympathized
with
the
great
principle
for
which
the
american
nation
so
nobly
contended
in
the
war
of
1812
what
that
was
i
suppose
all
my
readers
understand
the
british
at
war
with
france
had
denied
the
americans
the
right
to
trade
thither
she
had
impressed
american
seamen
and
forcibly
compelled
their
service
in
her
navy
she
had
violated
the
american
flag
by
insolently
searching
their
vessels
for
her
runaway
seamen
free
trade
and
sailors’
rights
therefore
were
the
objects
contended
for
by
the
americans
with
these
objects
our
men
could
but
sympathize
whatever
our
officers
might
do
on
the
other
hand
the
crew
of
our
opponent
had
all
shipped
voluntarily
for
the
term
of
two
years
only
most
of
our
men
were
shipped
for
life
they
understood
what
they
fought
for
they
were
better
used
in
the
service
what
wonder
then
that
victory
adorned
the
brows
of
the
american
commander
to
have
been
defeated
under
such
circumstances
would
have
been
a
source
of
lasting
infamy
to
any
naval
officer
in
the
world
in
the
matter
of
fighting
i
think
there
is
but
little
difference
in
either
nation
place
them
in
action
under
equal
circumstances
and
motives
and
who
could
predict
which
would
be
victor
unite
them
together
they
would
subject
the
whole
world
so
close
are
the
alliances
of
blood
however
between
england
and
america
that
it
is
to
be
earnestly
desired
they
may
never
meet
in
mortal
strife
again
if
either
will
fight
which
is
to
be
deprecated
as
a
crime
and
a
folly
let
it
choose
an
enemy
less
connected
by
the
sacred
ties
of
consanguinity
our
voyage
was
one
of
considerable
excitement
the
seas
swarmed
with
british
cruisers
and
it
was
extremely
doubtful
whether
the
united
states
would
elude
their
grasp
and
reach
the
protection
of
an
american
port
with
her
prize
i
hoped
most
sincerely
to
avoid
them
as
did
most
of
my
old
shipmates
in
this
we
agreed
with
our
captors
who
wisely
desired
to
dispose
of
one
conquest
before
they
attempted
another
our
former
officers
of
course
were
anxious
for
the
sight
of
a
british
flag
but
we
saw
none
and
after
a
prosperous
voyage
from
the
scene
of
conflict
we
heard
the
welcome
cry
of
land
ho
the
united
states
entered
the
port
of
new
london
but
owing
to
a
sudden
shift
of
the
wind
the
macedonian
had
to
lay
off
and
on
for
several
hours
had
an
english
cruiser
found
us
in
this
situation
we
should
have
been
easily
recovered
and
as
it
was
extremely
probable
we
should
fall
in
with
one
i
felt
quite
uneasy
until
after
several
hours
we
made
out
to
run
into
the
pretty
harbor
of
newport
we
fired
a
salute
as
we
came
to
an
anchor
which
was
promptly
returned
by
the
people
on
shore
with
a
few
exceptions
our
wounded
men
were
in
a
fair
way
to
recover
by
the
time
we
reached
newport
the
last
of
them
who
died
of
their
wounds
on
board
was
buried
just
before
we
got
in
his
name
was
thomas
whittaker
he
had
been
badly
wounded
by
splinters
while
he
lived
he
endured
excessive
torture
at
last
his
sufferings
rendered
him
crazy
in
which
sad
state
he
died
he
was
sewed
up
in
his
hammock
by
his
messmates
and
carried
on
a
grating
to
the
larboard
bow
port
there
mr
archer
a
midshipman
of
the
macedonian
read
the
beautiful
burial
service
of
the
church
of
england
when
he
came
to
that
most
touching
passage
we
commit
the
body
of
our
brother
to
the
deep
the
grating
was
elevated
and
amid
the
most
profound
silence
the
body
fell
heavily
into
the
waters
as
it
dropped
into
the
deep
a
sigh
escaped
from
many
a
friendly
bosom
and
an
air
of
passing
melancholy
shrouded
many
a
face
with
sadness
old
recollections
were
busy
there
calling
up
the
losses
of
the
battle
but
it
was
only
momentary
the
men
brushed
away
their
tears
muttered
it’s
no
use
to
fret
and
things
once
more
wore
their
wonted
aspect
at
newport
our
wounded
were
carried
on
shore
our
former
officers
also
left
us
here
when
my
master
mr
walker
took
his
leave
of
me
he
appeared
deeply
affected
imprinting
a
kiss
on
my
cheek
the
tears
started
from
his
eyes
and
he
bade
me
adieu
i
have
not
seen
him
since
while
we
lay
here
a
few
days
several
of
our
men
contrived
to
run
away
i
should
have
done
so
too
but
for
the
vigilance
of
the
prize
officers
who
were
ordered
to
keep
us
that
we
might
be
exchanged
for
those
americans
who
had
fallen
into
british
hands
after
staying
a
short
time
in
this
port
we
got
under
weigh
and
ran
into
new
london
here
we
fired
a
gun
as
a
signal
it
was
answered
by
the
united
states
and
both
ships
were
presently
sailing
in
company
to
new
york
we
found
the
sound
plentifully
dotted
with
sloops
carrying
passengers
for
this
was
before
the
days
of
modern
steamboating
after
we
reached
hurl-gate
vessels
here
gave
us
plenty
of
employment
most
of
them
honored
us
with
three
cheers
as
they
passed
of
course
the
prize
crew
could
do
no
less
than
cheer
again
so
that
we
passed
our
time
amidst
continued
cheering
while
here
we
were
favored
with
abundant
visitors
curious
to
see
the
captive
frigate
finding
these
visitors
extremely
inquisitive
and
being
tolerably
good-natured
myself
i
found
a
profitable
business
in
conducting
them
about
the
ship
describing
the
action
and
pointing
out
the
places
where
particular
individuals
fell
for
these
services
i
gained
some
money
and
more
good
will
the
people
who
had
been
to
see
us
used
to
tell
on
shore
how
they
had
been
on
board
of
us
and
how
the
english
boy
had
conducted
them
over
the
ship
and
told
them
the
particulars
of
the
fight
it
soon
became
quite
common
for
those
who
came
to
inquire
if
i
was
the
english
boy
that
was
taken
in
her
this
civility
on
my
part
was
not
without
a
motive
it
was
productive
of
profit
and
i
wanted
money
to
aid
me
whenever
i
got
clear
which
i
was
fully
determined
to
do
the
first
opportunity
to
this
step
i
was
encouraged
by
our
pilot
who
brought
us
from
new
london
mr
tinker
he
promised
to
take
me
as
his
apprentice
if
i
ran
away
also
a
gentleman
who
visited
us
told
me
to
call
at
his
house
in
pearl
street
and
he
would
give
me
a
dinner
many
others
advised
me
to
get
away
if
possible
but
i
was
so
closely
watched
that
my
mind
was
haunted
with
fear
lest
after
all
i
should
be
sent
back
to
england
in
the
cartel
which
was
expected
every
day
for
the
release
of
the
prisoners
to
fail
in
the
attempt
exposed
me
to
the
danger
of
being
reported
to
the
officer
who
might
come
for
us
and
thus
i
was
liable
to
be
flogged
whenever
i
arrived
in
a
british
port
great
caution
was
therefore
necessary
in
making
the
effort
since
it
was
better
not
to
try
at
all
than
to
fail
of
success
christmas
was
now
drawing
near
the
day
before
christmas
day
the
americans
contrived
to
get
well
supplied
with
wine
from
a
barrel
they
found
below
as
they
had
no
funds
i
bought
my
messmates
some
apples
and
a
turkey
so
that
on
the
morrow
they
were
quite
taken
up
with
feasting
we
also
had
a
great
many
visitors
that
day
many
of
them
were
ladies
and
the
officers
got
a
chair
out
which
captain
carden
had
rigged
up
to
lift
ladies
on
board
it
was
made
from
an
old
hogshead
in
the
following
manner
one
head
was
knocked
out
and
the
barrel
scooped
out
in
front
a
seat
was
then
inserted
with
a
flag
thrown
over
the
whole
so
that
when
it
was
lowered
into
a
boat
alongside
the
lady
had
but
to
step
in
and
throw
the
flag
round
her
feet
in
a
trice
the
chair
was
whipt
upon
deck
by
the
halyards
when
the
lady
could
step
out
with
perfect
ease
this
contrivance
afforded
a
great
deal
of
amusement
and
kept
the
officers
busily
occupied
in
waiting
upon
their
lady
visitors
now
then
thought
i
is
my
time
for
escape
or
not
at
all
i
had
already
made
a
friend
of
the
american
boatswain
mr
dawson
who
promised
to
carry
my
clothes
to
new
york
if
i
got
clear
so
looking
over
the
ship’s
side
i
saw
a
small
colored
boy
in
a
boat
can
you
tell
me
said
i
hailing
him
where
i
can
get
some
geese
and
turkeys
on
shore
for
our
officers
i
guess
you
can
at
some
of
the
houses
responded
the
lad
well
then
i
continued
will
you
set
me
ashore
i
want
to
get
some
for
our
officers
to
this
he
replied
yes
if
you
will
go
and
ask
my
master
who
is
on
board
your
ship
this
was
a
damper
on
my
young
hopes
since
it
was
not
likely
that
his
master
would
give
permission
i
went
below
somewhat
disconcerted
there
i
met
a
boy
named
james
day
two
years
younger
than
myself
i
told
him
i
was
going
to
run
away
and
urged
him
to
go
with
me
he
declined
at
first
saying
i
have
no
money
to
pay
my
expenses
but
i
have
money
returned
i
and
as
long
as
i
have
a
shilling
you
shall
have
half
of
it
besides
continued
he
i
am
afraid
we
cannot
get
away
without
being
caught
and
so
get
a
thorough
flogging
never
mind
that
said
i
i
have
contrived
that
business
the
boat’s
waiting
to
set
us
ashore
come
along
jim
don’t
be
frightened
‘nothing
venture
nothing
have,’
you
know
come
come
here’s
the
boat
alongside
at
length
he
consented
we
returned
to
the
ship’s
side
and
told
the
boy
his
master
was
willing
provided
he
would
make
haste
we
jumped
into
the
boat
and
were
soon
hurrying
towards
the
shore
full
of
the
hope
of
freedom
never
did
my
heart
misgive
me
as
it
did
when
we
were
on
our
way
to
the
shore
the
voice
of
the
boy’s
master
came
echoing
along
the
waves
where
are
you
going
with
that
boat
he
shouted
recovering
myself
i
persuaded
the
boy
he
was
only
bidding
him
to
make
haste
so
the
lad
replied
i
am
going
to
get
some
geese
sir
and
pulled
on
a
few
minutes
more
and
to
my
unspeakable
delight
i
stood
on
american
soil
giving
the
boy
a
half
dollar
we
pushed
on
for
new
york
some
ten
miles
distant
for
this
act
of
running
away
i
have
never
blamed
myself
for
the
means
by
which
it
was
effected
i
have
frequently
done
so
as
the
reader
has
seen
it
was
done
at
the
expense
of
truth
i
told
several
deliberate
lies
to
the
deceived
boy
in
the
boat
this
is
inexcusable
and
the
only
palliation
that
can
be
offered
is
my
want
of
religious
instruction
i
was
not
then
a
christian
still
the
act
of
lying
was
an
offence
before
god
and
no
man
should
purchase
his
liberty
at
the
price
of
a
lie
he
who
saves
his
life
at
the
cost
of
offending
god
pays
dearly
for
the
purchase
i
am
thankful
i
have
since
learned
this
lesson
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
of
jesus
christ
not
having
our
land
legs
on
we
soon
became
excessively
fatigued
when
within
two
or
three
miles
of
the
city
we
concluded
to
stop
all
night
at
a
tavern
on
the
road
the
inmates
looked
somewhat
surprised
to
see
two
sailor
lads
inquiring
for
lodgings
so
i
at
once
told
them
we
were
runaways
from
the
captured
frigate
this
made
them
our
friends
the
evening
passed
quite
pleasantly
we
relating
the
particulars
of
the
battle
and
singing
sea
songs
and
they
listening
with
the
utmost
good
humor
it
seemed
strange
to
us
to
find
ourselves
in
a
bed
after
sleeping
two
years
and
a
half
in
a
hammock
nevertheless
we
slept
soundly
and
to
our
inexpressible
pleasure
arose
in
the
morning
at
our
leisure
without
being
driven
by
the
swearing
boatswain
at
our
heels
after
breakfast
our
generous
host
having
refused
to
receive
any
payment
for
his
hospitality
we
set
out
for
the
city
of
new
york
here
i
very
fortunately
alighted
on
one
of
the
crew
of
the
macedonian
named
fitzgibbons
who
informed
me
that
most
of
our
men
had
been
landed
at
new
london
and
confined
as
prisoners
in
an
old
barn
but
that
not
being
over
closely
guarded
most
of
them
had
run
away
he
also
introduced
me
to
a
sailors’
boarding-house
kept
by
a
widow
named
elms
near
the
old
fly
market
in
front
street
after
spending
a
week
in
roving
about
the
city
i
heard
a
tremendous
roaring
of
cannon
in
the
harbor
it
proceeded
from
the
two
frigates--which
had
dropped
down
from
hurl-gate
and
hauled
up
off
the
navy
yard
what
was
more
to
my
satisfaction
however
was
the
news
that
the
cartel
had
arrived
and
carried
off
the
british
crew
or
rather
the
fragment
that
remained
of
them
had
i
delayed
my
escape
three
days
longer
instead
of
spending
the
rest
of
my
days
in
america
and
in
the
american
service
i
should
have
been
chained
to
the
obnoxious
discipline
of
the
british
navy
the
reader
may
be
assured
that
the
narrowness
of
my
escape
very
greatly
enhanced
the
value
i
set
upon
my
freedom
i
now
ventured
on
board
the
macedonian
again
to
obtain
my
clothes
as
i
stepped
on
board
my
mind
misgave
me
as
lieutenant
nicholson
eyed
me
somewhat
sternly
but
i
was
reassured
when
kindly
speaking
he
informed
me
that
the
cartel
was
gone
and
i
was
safe
the
sailors
also
congratulated
me
on
my
success
in
getting
clear
the
officers
and
crew
were
about
to
have
a
public
dinner
and
to
visit
the
theatre
in
commemoration
of
their
achievement
the
sailors
invited
me
to
join
them
to
this
i
agreed
but
overhauling
my
clothes
and
contriving
how
i
should
appear
as
well
as
any
shipmates
who
were
all
going
to
have
new
suits
for
the
occasion
the
bright
anchor
buttons
which
shone
on
my
best
suit
presented
an
insuperable
objection
for
how
could
i
appear
among
them
with
the
badge
of
the
british
service
on
my
coat
this
dilemma
was
removed
however
by
the
skill
of
my
landlady
the
widow
who
very
carefully
covered
the
buttons
with
blue
cloth
there
was
great
excitement
in
new
york
when
the
brave
tars
of
the
victorious
united
states
walked
in
triumphant
procession
through
the
streets
in
the
presence
of
countless
citizens
first
came
captain
carden’s
band
which
had
now
shipped
with
decatur
they
were
followed
by
the
commodore
and
his
officers
and
these
by
the
crew
at
the
city
hotel
all
hands
partook
of
a
sumptuous
dinner
this
was
followed
by
rather
more
than
a
usual
amount
of
drinking
laughing
and
talking
for
as
liquor
was
furnished
in
great
abundance
the
men
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
get
drunk
as
they
left
the
room
to
go
to
the
theatre
the
poor
plates
on
the
sideboard
proclaimed
that
jack
was
full
three
sheets
in
the
wind
almost
every
one
as
he
passed
gave
them
a
crack
crying
out
as
they
fell
save
the
pieces
thus
illustrating
the
old
proverb
when
rum
is
in
wit
is
out
the
visit
to
the
theatre
passed
off
very
much
like
the
dinner
to
wit
there
was
an
abundance
of
shouting
and
cheering
all
the
evening
after
the
close
of
the
play
all
hands
scattered
to
see
their
friends
with
orders
to
be
on
board
next
day
it
was
a
week
before
they
all
returned
i
was
much
struck
with
the
appearance
of
decatur
that
evening
as
he
sat
in
full
uniform
his
pleasant
face
flushed
with
the
excitement
of
the
occasion
he
formed
a
striking
contrast
to
the
appearance
he
made
when
he
visited
our
ship
on
the
passage
to
new
york
then
he
wore
an
old
straw
hat
and
a
plain
suit
of
clothes
which
made
him
look
more
like
a
farmer
than
a
naval
commander
never
had
men
more
friends
than
the
crew
of
the
united
states
at
this
period
every
boarding-house
was
open
to
them
every
merchant
would
trust
them
every
one
was
willing
to
lend
them
money
what
was
it
that
gained
them
such
public
favor
o
their
victory
of
course
replies
the
reader
stop
i
will
reveal
the
secret
they
had
some
prize
money
coming
to
them
in
a
few
weeks
that
was
the
key
that
unlocked
coffers
the
warmth
that
melted
the
heart
the
spirit
that
clothed
the
face
with
smiles
but
for
that--the
prize
money--poor
jack’s
credit
and
favor
would
as
usual
have
been
below
par
of
course
this
profusion
this
universal
popularity
almost
turned
the
brains
of
some
of
those
old
tars
and
at
every
opportunity
they
would
steal
ashore
for
a
spree
this
brought
them
into
trouble
it
brought
some
of
them
to
the
gangway
to
be
flogged
these
floggings
however
were
not
very
severe
they
were
rather
a
species
of
farce
enacted
to
preserve
alive
the
forms
of
discipline
to
avoid
even
these
forms
the
men
were
accustomed
after
staying
on
a
spree
for
several
days
to
visit
the
commodore’s
lady
with
some
piteous
tale
begging
her
to
intercede
for
them
with
their
captain
this
she
did
with
almost
constant
success
the
lucky
tar
would
then
go
on
board
telling
his
messmates
that
she
was
the
sailor’s
friend
and
using
the
usual
saying
in
such
cases
good
luck
to
her--she
has
a
soul
to
be
saved
by
this
time
the
late
crew
of
the
macedonian
or
those
of
them
who
had
not
gone
home
with
the
cartel
were
pretty
well
scattered
over
the
country
one
of
the
marines
named
luke
oil
went
to
springfield
mass
where
he
was
employed
as
a
file-cutter
by
colonel
lee
of
the
u
s
armory
at
the
rate
of
75
per
month
this
prosperity
and
an
unfortunate
marriage
led
him
into
unsteady
habits
he
enlisted
into
the
u
s
army
but
growing
sick
of
that
colonel
lee
procured
his
discharge
he
afterwards
enlisted
again
which
is
the
last
i
ever
heard
of
luke
oil
two
more
of
our
marines
named
shipley
and
taylor
also
went
to
springfield
and
were
employed
by
a
mr
ames
several
of
the
others
enlisted
to
serve
in
the
fort
at
new
london
one
of
these
whose
name
was
hawkins
was
very
highly
esteemed
for
his
excellence
as
a
soldier
and
was
soon
made
sergeant
but
being
an
inveterate
drunkard
he
lost
his
office
and
was
degraded
to
the
ranks
i
have
a
characteristic
anecdote
to
record
of
sadler
the
messmate
of
bob
hammond
he
enlisted
in
the
american
army
and
was
quartered
at
hartford
he
was
so
delighted
with
everything
american
that
he
had
grown
to
be
an
enthusiast
in
his
encomiums
on
the
government
as
was
exhibited
one
day
in
a
somewhat
peculiar
way
the
company
to
which
he
belonged
was
marched
to
church
one
sabbath
to
hear
i
think
it
was
priest
strong.[15
the
text
was
fear
god
and
honor
the
king
this
was
too
much
for
the
newly-made
american
and
he
put
the
congregation
into
a
broad
grin
by
exclaiming
aloud
don’t
let
us
hear
about
the
king
but
about
congress
the
good
people
of
hartford
would
have
pardoned
this
violation
of
puritan
propriety
if
they
had
seen
that
brave
fellow
flogged
as
i
had
in
the
king’s
service
our
fifer
charles
robinson
also
enlisted
in
the
same
regiment
perhaps
some
of
the
inhabitants
of
hartford
still
remember
the
soldier
who
amused
them
during
his
stay
by
playing
on
the
bugle
in
the
morning
from
the
top
of
the
court-house
robinson
was
perfect
master
of
several
instruments
especially
the
fife
and
the
bugle
one
of
our
boys
named
william
madden
but
better
known
in
the
macedonian
by
the
nick-name
of
billy
o’rook
from
his
practice
of
singing
a
song
about
that
hero
enlisted
in
the
army
and
afterwards
performed
a
signal
service
for
his
adopted
country
at
sacket’s
harbor
the
americans
were
in
full
retreat
before
the
british
troops
whose
general,[16
mounted
on
a
superb
charger
was
at
their
head
shouting
huzza
my
boys
the
day
is
ours
when
young
madden
rendered
desperate
by
the
certainty
of
being
shot
if
taken
by
his
countrymen
deliberately
aimed
his
rifle
at
the
general
the
shot
struck
him
he
fell
and
the
british
retreated
this
brave
lad

his
life

a
subsequent
action
i
make
this
statement
on
the
authority
of
captain
badger
of
williamstown
mass
confirmed
by
the
testimony
of
several
other
persons
the
reader
has
probably
not
forgotten
the
name
of
bloody
dick
he
shipped
on
board
the
hornet
sloop
of
war
and
with
that
vessel
very
narrowly
escaped
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
english
i
met
him
afterwards
in
new
york
he
told
me
how
he
trembled
during
the
chase
knowing
that
if
captured
he
should
be
hung
for
entering
the
american
service
the
british
having
given
express
orders
for
a
strict
look-out
after
our
crew
that
they
might
make
examples
of
them
besides
the
men
just
mentioned
others
of
our
crew
shipped
and
wandered
in
every
direction
some
in
men
of
war
some
in
merchant
vessels
some
fearful
of
the
risk
of
being
retaken
settled
ashore
in
short
it
is
impossible
to
trace
them
so
variously
did
they
diverge
from
each
other
i
have
been
particular
in
mentioning
the
history
of
a
few
to
gratify
the
parties
should
they
be
living
and
ever
see
my
book
to
confirm
the
reader
in
the
truthfulness
of
my
account
and
to
show
some
of
the
changes
that
followed
in
consequence
of
the
victory
of
the
united
states
over
the
macedonian
it
would
be
an
interesting
task
were
it
possible
to
trace
out
all
the
results
of
that
victory
having
detained
the
reader
thus
long
in
following
the
fate
of
my
shipmates
i
will
resume
the
record
of
my
own
in
the

chapter
viii
nearly
two
weeks
had
passed
since
i
left
the
macedonian
i
and
my
companion
were
living
upon
the
sums
i
had
saved
from
the
presents
i
received
for
my
civilities
to
her
numerous
visitors
one
day
as
i
was
sauntering
round
the
wharves
with
my
protégé
i
met
a
number
of
men-of-war’s
men
stepping
up
to
them
i
perceived
some
of
the
old
macedonians
of
course
i
hailed
them
they
were
glad
to
see
me
they
had
shipped
on
board
the
john
adams
guard
ship
to
which
they
were
returning
having
been
enjoying
a
few
days’
liberty
nothing
would
satisfy
them
but
for
us
to
accompany
them
and
ship
too
the
midshipman
who
was
with
them
joined
his
entreaties
to
theirs
and
we
at
last
consented
to
avoid
being
detected
by
the
british
it
was
usual
for
our
men
to
assume
new
names
and
to
hail
from
some
american
port
on
shipping
in
an
american
vessel
my
shipmates
advised
me
to
do
the
same
to
this
i
had
some
objections
because
i
knew
that
changing
my
name
would
not
make
me
a
yankee
while
it
might
bring
me
into
as
awkward
a
position
as
it
did
an
irishman
who
was
found
by
an
english
cruiser
on
board
an
american
vessel
after
he
had
declared
himself
an
american
the
officer
asked
him
what
part
of
america
did
you
come
from
i
used
to
belong
to
philamadelph
but
now
i
belong
to
philama
york
replied
paddy
concealing
his
brogue
as
much
as
possible
well
continued
the
officer
can
you
say
pease
pase
sir
said
pat
in
true
irish
style
the
officer
laughed
and
replied
mr
pase
you
will
please
to
get
into
the
boat
the
poor
irishman
was
unsuccessful
in
playing
the
yankee
mentioning
these
fears
the
midshipman
said
call
yourself
william
harper
and
hail
from
philadelphia
then
turning
to
my
companion
he
added
and
call
yourself
james
wilson
but
said
i
suppose
the
officer
should
ask
any
questions
about
philadelphia
what
should
i
do
o
say
you
belong
to
pine
street
but
what
if
he
asks
me
in
what
part
of
the
city
pine
street
is
situated
and
what
streets
join
it
i
answered
determined
not
to
take
a
step
in
the
dark
if
i
could
avoid
it
the
midshipman
assured
me
that
no
such
questions
would
be
put
and
partly
confiding
and
partly
doubting
i
resolved
to
make
the
experiment
going
on
board
we
were
paraded
before
the
officers
addressing
me
one
of
them
said
well
my
boy
what
is
your
name
mustering
all
the
confidence
i
could
command
i
boldly
answered
william
harper
sir
what
part
of
america
do
you
belong
to
my
boy
philadelphia
sir
here
one
of
the
officers
smiled
and
remarked
ah
a
townsman
i
trembled
at
hearing
this
inwardly
hoping
that
they
would
ask
me
no
more
questions
to
my
increased
alarm
however
he
continued
by
asking
what
street
in
philadelphia
pine
street
sir
said
i
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
feels
himself
drawn
toward
a
crisis
he
cannot
escape
what
street
joins
pine
street
my
lad
asked
my
tormentor
with
a
knowing
laugh
this
was
a
poser
for
further
than
this
my
instructions
had
not
proceeded
however
i
rallied
the
little
confidence
which
remained
and
said
i
don’t
remember
sir
the
officer
who
had
claimed
me
as
a
townsman
mentioned
the
next
street
and
my
examiner
went
on
by
asking
me
what
street
joined
the
one
mentioned
by
the
officer
my
colors
which
had
fallen
to
half-mast
before
were
now
fairly
struck
i
had
to
surrender
at
discretion
but
thinking
to
get
off
with
the
honors
of
war
i
answered
gentlemen
it
is
so
long
since
i
was
in
philadelphia
i
have
forgotten
all
about
it
this
point
blank
shot
might
have
saved
me
when
as
if
providence
had
determined
to
make
my
attempt
at
lying
a
total
failure
one
of
them
detected
a
glittering
anchor
button
which
had
contrived
to
get
rid
of
the
covering
placed
over
it
by
the
fingers
of
the
widow
pointing
it
out
to
the
others
he
said
where
did
you
get
that
english
button
did
you
pick
it
up
in
philadelphia
this
was
a
shot
which
raked
me
fore
and
aft
i
hauled
down
my
colors
and
stood
silent
the
officers
laughed
heartily
as
one
of
them
said
go
below
my
lad
you
will
make
a
pretty
good
yankee
through
all
this
procedure
the
reader
will
perceive
how
perfect
was
the
disregard
of
truth
among
all
parties
from
my
humble
self
to
the
officers
who
were
evidently
rather
pleased
than
otherwise
at
my
attempt
to
pass
for
an
american
such
an
absence
of
moral
rectitude
is
deplorable
it
exhibits
the
unfitness
of
the
parties
for
a
mansion
in
his
kingdom
who
is
a
god
of
truth
it
lays
the
foundation
for
a
mutual
distrust
and
suspicion
among
men
and
it
leaves
the
offender
to
meet
a
fearful
weight
of
responsibility
in
the
day
that
shall
try
every
man’s
work
i
am
thankful
that
the
influences
of
christianity
have
fallen
upon
me
since
that
time
in
such
abundance
as
to
renew
the
spirit
of
my
mind
and
to
fill
me
with
abhorrence
towards
a
violation
of
truth
the
next
morning
i
and
my
companion
who
had
escaped
the
ordeal
that
had
proved
too
much
for
me
were
summoned
to
go
ashore
to
the
rendezvous
that
we
might
sign
the
ship’s
articles
or
in
sailor
phrase
get
shipped
the
officer
of
the
watch
shouted
boatswain’s
mate
sir
answered
a
deep
gruff
voice
pipe
away
the
cutter
said
the
officer
aye
aye
sir
pass
the
word
for
james
wilson
and
william
harper
aye
aye
sir
then
followed
a
loud
shrill
whistle
accompanied
with
the
cry
of
away
there
cutters
away
we
were
also
summoned
to
appear
and
told
to
take
our
seats
in
the
cutter
which
by
this
time
lay
alongside
manned
by
her
crew
of
six
men
who
sat
each
with
his
oar
elevated
in
the
air
waiting
the
word
of
command
we
were
soon
seated
the
lieutenant
passed
the
words
let
fall
and
give
way
the
oars
fell
into
the
water
with
admirable
precision
and
away
we
flew
towards
the
shore
on
our
way
to
the
rendezvous
i
told
my
companion
i
should
not
ship
in
the
john
adams
because
so
many
of
the
macedonians
were
already
there
and
it
was
impossible
for
us
to
pass
for
americans
after
some
debate
we
agreed
together
not
to
sign
the
articles
on
entering
the
house
where
the
stars
and
stripes
were
flying
over
the
door
in
token
of
its
being
the
naval
rendezvous
being
anxious
to
have
my
friend
wilson
pass
the
ordeal
first
i
affected
to
stumble
and
then
continued
apparently
engaged
in
fixing
my
shoe-string
well
my
boy
what
is
your
name
just
sign
it
here
will
you
said
the
officer
i
took
no
notice
but
remained
very
busy
with
my
shoes
my
shipmate
replied
in
a
low
bashful
voice
i
don’t
like
to
ship
sir
very
well
then
go
below
said
the
officer
at
this
juncture
feeling
encouraged
by
his
remark
i
looked
up
when
to
my
discomfiture
the
officer
fixing
his
eyes
on
my
retreating
companion
observed
that
fellow
will
certainly
be
hung
meaning
that
he
would
get
caught
by
the
english
then
addressing
me
he
said
now
my
lad
just
sign
your
name
sir
said
i
i
had
better
not
ship
alone
the
other
boy
is
only
frightened
let
me
talk
to
him
a
little
and
i
can
persuade
him
to
ship
with
me
the
shipping
officer
was
too
old
a
bird
to
be
snared
with
such
chaff
as
this
so
speaking
rather
sharply
he
said
let
him
go
sir
and
ship
yourself
then
he’ll
come
back
and
join
you
and”--he
smiled
as
he
spoke--“i
will
let
you
come
ashore
to
persuade
him
in
a
day
or
two
still
i
pretended
not
to
be
convinced
and
after
considerable
debate
he
let
me
off
once
more
clear
i
joined
my
young
shipmate
and
we
proceeded
together
to
our
boarding-house
congratulating
ourselves
on
our
fortunate
escape
as
it
appeared
to
us
two
weeks
of
idleness
had
nearly
exhausted
the
little
stock
of
funds
i
had
picked
up
on
board
my
old
ship
and
it
was
becoming
necessary
for
me
to
find
some
means
or
other
of
supporting
myself
for
although
the
prim
widow
with
whom
i
boarded
was
quite
obliging
while
her
bills
were
paid
it
was
altogether
probable
that
she
would
become
a
little
crusty
if
they
should
be
neglected
at
this
crisis
i
fortunately
met
with
an
englishman
who
had
visited
our
frigate
at
hurl-gate
his
name
was
smith
he
was
a
deserter
from
the
british
army
but
was
now
settled
in
new
york
as
a
boot-maker
in
the
employment
of
the
firm
of
benton

co
broadway
he
offered
to
take
me
and
initiate
me
into
the
art
science
and
secrets
of
boot-making
seeing
no
better
opportunity
before
me
i
accepted
his
kind
offer
and
at
once
entered
on
my
novitiate
behold
me
then
kind
reader
transformed
from
the
character
of
a
runaway
british
sailor
into
that
of
a
quiet
scholar
at
the
feet
of
st
crispin
where
in
the
matter
of
awls
wax-ends
lapstones
and
pegs
i
soon
became
quite
proficient
it
is
altogether
probable
that
the
rest
of
my
life
would
have
glided
away
in
this
still
and
quiet
manner
but
for
a
report
that
reached
me
one
sabbath
as
i
was
wasting
its
precious
hours
in
wandering
about
among
the
shipping
this
was
that
there
was
a
tall
stout
seaman
on
board
the
united
states
named
george
turner
from
the
name
and
description
i
had
no
doubt
that
this
was
my
cousin
who
the
reader
has
not
forgotten
i
presume
presented
himself
so
unceremoniously
to
my
aunt
at
wanstead
this
intelligence
determined
me
to
pay
that
frigate
a
visit
going
on
board
i
found
her
crew
living
in
a
complete
elysium
of
sensual
enjoyment
they
had
recently
received
their
prize
money
salt
beef
and
pork
were
now
rejected
with
disdain
jack’s
messkids
smoked
with
more
savory
viands
such
as
soft
tack
bread
and
butter
fried
eggs
sausages
c
the
whole
well
soaked
with
copious
streams
of
rum
and
brandy
those
of
the
crew
who
had
been
in
the
macedonian
hailed
me
with
a
hearty
welcome
those
for
whom
i
had
bought
the
turkey
and
apples
at
christmas
repaid
me
fourfold
so
that
when
i
went
ashore
that
night
my
purse
was
as
heavy
as
on
the
afternoon
when
i
quitted
my
ship
my
cousin
did
not
recognise
me
at
first
but
by
referring
him
to
his
visit
to
my
old
abode
he
at
last
felt
satisfied
that
i
was
his
cousin
he
then
charged
me
not
to
mention
our
relationship
because
he
wished
to
pass
for
an
american
having
given
me
this
charge
he
surveyed
me
from
head
to
foot
and
then
said
what
are
you
doing
in
new
york
i
am
learning
to
make
boots
and
shoes
i
am
sorry
you
are
bound
to
a
shoemaker
said
he
i
don’t
like
that
business
i
am
not
bound
to
mr
smith
but
can
leave
him
when
i
please
well
then
he
remarked
thoughtfully
i
don’t
want
you
to
go
to
sea
again
go
to
salem
in
the
state
of
massachusetts
i
have
a
wife
and
children
there
and
shall
be
at
home
in
a
few
weeks
this
was
a
kind
offer
and
i
at
once
agreed
to
take
his
advice
i
had
already
grown
somewhat
weary
with
the
confinement
of
my
new
mode
of
life
though
on
the
whole
considering
my
education
and
the
character
of
the
influence
exerted
upon
me
in
the
macedonian
i
was
a
steady
lad
mr
smith
had
left
me
pretty
much
to
my
own
inclinations
during
the
two
months
of
my
residence
with
him
yet
my
utmost
misconduct
had
been
the
drinking
of
a
little
spirit
and
the
violation
of
the
sabbath
by
roaming
about
the
docks
and
wharves
my
sabbath
evenings
i
had
usually
spent
in
a
more
profitable
manner
it
being
my
habit
to
spend
them
at
the
methodist
chapel
in
duane
street
on
returning
to
the
house
of
my
kind
employer
i
lost
no
time
in
communicating
to
him
my
change
of
purpose
he
objected
and
justly
too
to
be
left
just
as
the
pains
he
had
taken
to
instruct
me
were
about
to
be
requited
by
my
usefulness
however
as
i
offered
him
five
dollars
he
consented
to
my
departure
at
that
time
there
were
no
steamboats
ploughing
the
waters
of
the
sound
so
i
engaged
a
steerage
passage
to
providence
for
five
dollars
on
board
a
packet
sloop
and
with
a
light
heart
and
elastic
step
carried
my
clothes-bag
on
board
here
however
i
met
with
a
trifling
loss
while
ashore
waiting
for
a
fair
wind
a
negro
who
had
engaged
a
passage
in
the
sloop
robbed
my
bag
of
several
articles
of
wearing
apparel
and
took
french
leave
in
consideration
of
this
mishap
the
captain
exacted
only
three
dollars
passage-money
from
providence
a
stage
chartered
exclusively
by
a
party
of
sailors
conveyed
me
to
boston
from
whence
i
soon
reached
the
house
of
my
cousin
in
salem
mrs
turner
received
me
with
great
kindness
indeed
she
pretended
not
to
be
surprised
at
my
visit
assigning
as
a
reason
the
very
satisfactory
fact
that
she
had
seen
me
with
my
bag
on
my
shoulder
in
the
grounds
of
a
teacup
she
was
a
believer
in
fortune-telling
and
dreams
having
for
aught
i
know
received
her
convictions
as
an
heirloom
from
her
witch-burning[17
ancestors
at
any
rate
she
was
strongly
confirmed
in
her
favorite
theory
by
my
timely
arrival
verifying
as
it
did
to
the
very
particular
of
the
bag
on
the
shoulder
the
truth-telling
tea-grounds
she
gave
me
another
proof
after
i
had
been
there
a
few
weeks
of
the
truthfulness
and
verity
of
dreams
by
calling
me
up
one
morning
with
an
injunction
to
make
haste
to
the
post-office
for
she
had
dreamed
of
catching
fish
sure
enough
if
she
caught
no
fish
in
her
dreams
she
caught
a
very
fine
one
in
the
letter
i
brought
to
her
for
it
contained
a
one
hundred
dollar
bill
from
her
husband
with
information
that
his
ship
was
blockaded
in
the
port
of
new
london
by
commodore
hardy
accident
or
curiosity
i
forget
which
led
me
to
attend
the
religious
services
of
the
baptists
in
salem
they
were
enjoying
a
season
of
religious
refreshing
several
were
baptized
the
hymn
beginning
with
the
line
oh
how
happy
are
they
who
their
saviour
obey
was
sung
as
the
converts
came
out
of
the
water
and
made
a
strong
impression
on
my
mind
had
some
devoted
christian
made
himself
acquainted
with
my
feelings
and
given
me
suitable
advice
there
is
no
doubt
but
that
i
should
have
been
led
to
embrace
the
lord
jesus
christ
how
many
divine
impressions
are
destroyed
through
lack
of
faithfulness
in
christians
perhaps
the
great
reason
why
these
serious
impressions
were
so
transient
was
because
the
company
i
kept
was
so
unfavorable
to
their
growth
most
of
my
time
was
spent
about
the
shipping
among
these
were
many
privateers
the
profanity
of
whose
crews
was
such
that
it
had
passed
into
a
proverb
it
was
usual
to
say
to
a
gross
swearer
you
swear
like
a
privateer’s-man
religion
could
not
flourish
in
an
atmosphere
tainted
by
their
vices
among
my
favorite
pursuits
was
that
of
fishing
sometimes
i
went
with
mixed
parties
of
males
and
females
at
others
with
a
few
sailor
companions
one
of
these
excursions
came
very
near
costing
rather
more
than
it
was
worth
we
had
been
out
all
night
towards
morning
we
thought
we
would
get
a
little
sleep
and
for
this
purpose
laid
ourselves
down
under
the
top-gallant
forecastle
luckily
for
us
we
had
an
old
sailor
named
lewis
deal
on
board
he
had
been
quartermaster
on
board
the
united
states
knowing
that
the
coast
was
strictly
guarded
by
british
cruisers
he
kept
awake
just
at
dawn
the
bang
of
a
single
gun
led
him
to
call
us
saying
there
i
told
you
to
look
out
for
johnny
bull
looking
about
us
we
saw
an
english
gun
brig
in
chase
after
a
boston
sloop
this
was
a
sight
that
inspired
us
with
a
very
sudden
and
wonderful
agility
since
we
had
a
decided
repugnance
to
a
free
passage
in
the
aforesaid
brig
to
halifax
especially
as
in
my
case
it
might
have
the
rather
unpleasant
termination
of
an
airing
at
the
yard-arm
which
for
very
strong
reasons
i
chose
to
avoid
if
possible
by
dint
of
strong
arms
and
quick
movements
we
succeeded
in
hauling
in
our
anchor
and
getting
under
weigh
without
attracting
the
englishman’s
attention
expecting
a
shot
at
our
heels
every
moment
we
sat
breathlessly
measuring
our
distance
from
the
brig
fortunately
we
escaped
notice
and
reached
salem
in
safety
shortly
after
this
adventure
the
good
citizens
of
salem
were
thrown
into
a
high
state
of
excitement
by
the
noise
of
a
heavy
cannonading
a
general
rush
took
place
from
all
quarters
towards
the
neck
i
followed
with
the
rest
we
found
it
to
be
occasioned
by
the
engagement
between
the
chesapeake
and
shannon
in
compliance
with
a
challenge
sent
by
the
latter
which
was
accepted
by
captain
lawrence
of
the
former
the
result
is
well
known
after
a
short
action
the
chesapeake
struck
to
the
shannon
and
was
carried
away
by
the
victors
in
triumph
to
halifax
one
reason
for
the
defeat
of
the
american
frigate
may
perhaps
be
found
in
the
fact
that
her
crew
were
newly
shipped
some
of
them
were
volunteer
landsmen
while
none
of
them
had
what
sailors
call
their
sea-legs
on
no
ship
is
fit
for
action
until
she
has
been
at
sea
at
least
a
month
in
this
action
the
captain
first
lieutenant
and
several
men
were
killed
mr
george
crowninshield
sent
a
vessel
to
halifax
for
the
bodies
of
those
gallant
officers
they
were
interred
in
salem
with
naval
honors
my
cousin
having
now
reached
home
was
desirous
to
have
me
devote
myself
to
some
business
he
proposed
that
of
a
sailmaker
but
by
this
time
i
had
quite
a
desire
to
go
to
sea
again
the
constitution
the
frolic
sloop
of
war
and
the
gun
brig
siren
were
all
shipping
hands
in
boston
my
feelings
inclined
me
towards
old
ironsides
but
my
cousin
having
sailed
with
captain
parker,[18
of
the
siren
recommended
that
officer
so
strongly
that
i
was
induced
to
join
his
ship
in
company
with
the
quartermaster
and
several
of
the
former
hands
of
the
united
states
my
cousin
also
overruled
my
design
of
shipping
in
a
false
name
so
that
in
defiance
of
my
fears
i
suffered
myself
to
be
entered
as
samuel
leech
on
the
books
of
the
u
s
brig
siren
of
sixteen
guns
the
payment
of
three
months’
advance
with
the
sum
i
brought
with
me
from
new
york
enabled
me
honorably
to
discharge
my
board
bills
at
my
cousin’s
and
to
purchase
a
little
clothing
necessary
to
fit
me
for
sea
i
was
then
in
the
seventeenth
year
of
my
life
once
more
in
a
man
of
war
my
seriousness
all
vanished
like
mist
before
the
sun
alas
it
was
poor
soil
to
nourish
the
seed
of
life
barren
of
everything
that
related
to
purity
religion
and
immortality
my
first
impressions
of
the
american
service
were
very
favorable
the
treatment
in
the
siren
was
more
lenient
and
favorable
than
in
the
macedonian
the
captain
and
officers
were
kind
while
there
was
a
total
exemption
from
that
petty
tyranny
exercised
by
the
upstart
midshipmen
in
the
british
service
as
a
necessary
effect
our
crew
were
as
comfortable
and
as
happy
as
men
ever
are
in
a
man
of
war
while
we
lay
in
boston
harbor
thanksgiving-day
arrived
some
of
our
salem
men
inquired
if
i
was
not
going
home
to
keep
thanksgiving
for
they
all
supposed
i
belonged
to
salem
what
they
meant
by
thanksgiving
was
a
mystery
to
me
but
dissembling
my
ignorance
i
obtained
leave
determined
to
learn
what
it
meant
the
result
of
my
visit
was
the
idea
that
thanksgiving
was
one
in
which
the
people
crammed
themselves
with
turkeys
geese
pumpkin-pies
c
for
certainly
that
was
the
chief
business
of
the
day
so
far
as
i
could
perceive
with
too
many
people
i
believe
that
this
is
the
leading
idea
associated
with
the
day
even
now
our
brig
had
before
this
taken
in
her
guns
consisting
of
two
long
nine-pounders
twelve
twenty-four
pound
carronades
and
two
forty-two
pounders
our
crew
was
composed
of
some
one
hundred
and
twenty-five
smart
active
men
we
were
all
supplied
with
stout
leather
caps
something
like
those
used
by
firemen
these
were
crossed
by
two
strips
of
iron
covered
with
bearskin
and
were
designed
to
defend
the
head
in
boarding
an
enemy’s
ship
from
the
stroke
of
the
cutlass
strips
of
bearskin
were
likewise
used
to
fasten
them
on
serving
the
purpose
of
false
whiskers
and
causing
us
to
look
as
fierce
as
hungry
wolves
we
were
also
frequently
exercised
in
the
various
evolutions
of
a
sea-fight
first
using
our
cannon
then
seizing
our
cutlasses
and
boarding-pikes
and
cutting
to
the
right
and
left
as
if
in
the
act
of
boarding
an
enemy’s
ship
thus
we
spent
our
time
from
early
in
the
fall
until
after
christmas
when
we
received
orders
to
hold
ourselves
in
readiness
for

as
we
lay
waiting
for
our
final
orders
a
report
reached
us
that
a
large
english
brig
of
war
called
the
nimrod
lay
in
a
cove
somewhere
near
boston
bay
upon
this
information
our
officers
planned
a
night
expedition
for
the
purpose
of
effecting
her
capture
our
intended
mode
of
attack
was
to
run
close
alongside
pour
a
broadside
upon
her
and
then
without
further
ceremony
board
her
cutlass
in
hand
so
we
took
in
our
powder
ground
up
our
cutlasses
and
towards
night
got
under
weigh
a
change
in
the
wind
however
defeated
our
designs
and
we
put
into
salem
harbor
with
no
other
result
than
the
freezing
of
a
man’s
fingers
which
happened
while
we
were
furling
our
sails
thus
ended
our
first
warlike
expedition
in
the
siren
shortly
after
this
affair
we
received
orders
to
start
on
a
cruise
to
the
coast
of
africa
and
in
company
with
the
grand
turk_,[19
a
privateer
set
sail
from
salem
passing
the
fort
we
received
the
usual
hail
from
the
sentry
of
brig
ahoy
where
are
you
bound
to
to
this
salutation
the
first
lieutenant
jocosely
answered
there
and
back
again
on
a
man
of
war’s
cruise
such
a
reply
would
not
have
satisfied
a
british
soldier
but
we
shot
past
the
fort
unmolested
after
two
days
we
parted
company
with
the
grand
turk
and
by
the
aid
of
a
fair
wind
soon
found
ourselves
in
the
gulf
stream
where
instead
of
fearing
frozen
fingers
we
could
go
bare-footed
and
feel
quite
comfortable
we
now
kept
a
sharp
look-out
at
the
mast-head
but
met
with
nothing
until
we
reached
the
canary
islands
near
which
we
saw
a
boat-load
of
portuguese
who
coming
alongside
talked
in
their
native
tongue
with
great
noise
and
earnestness
but
were
no
more
intelligible
to
us
than
so
many
blackbirds
while
off
the
african
coast
our
captain
died
his
wasted
body
was
placed
in
a
coffin
with
shot
to
sink
it
after
the
service
had
been
read
the
plank
on
which
the
coffin
rested
was
elevated
and
it
slipped
into
the
great
deep
the
yards
were
braced
round
and
we
were
under
weigh
again
when
to
our
surprise
and
grief
we
saw
the
coffin
floating
on
the
waves
the
reason
was
the
carpenter
had
bored
holes
in
the
top
and
bottom
he
should
have
made
them
only
in
the
top
after
the
funeral
the
crew
were
called
aft
and
the
first
lieutenant
mr
nicholson,[20
told
us
that
it
should
be
left
to
our
decision
whether
he
should
assume
the
command
and
continue
the
cruise
or
return
home
we
gave
him
three
hearty
cheers
in
token
of
our
wish
to
continue
the
cruise
he
was
a
noble-minded
man
very
kind
and
civil
to
his
crew
and
the
opposite
in
every
respect
to
the
haughty
lordly
captain
with
whom
i
first
sailed
in
the
macedonian
seeing
me
one
day
with
rather
a
poor
hat
on
he
called
me
aft
and
presented
me
with
one
of
his
own
but
little
worn
good
luck
to
him
said
i
in
sailor
phrase
as
i
returned
to
my
messmates
he
has
a
soul
to
be
saved
we
also
lost
two
of
our
crew
who
fell
victims
to
the
heat
of
the
climate
one
morning
the
cry
of
sail
ho
directed
our
attention
to
a
strange
sail
which
had
hove
to
with
her
courses
hauled
up
at
first
we
took
her
for
a
british
man-of-war
brig
the
hands
were
summoned
to
quarters
and
the
ship
got
ready
for
action
a
nearer
approach
however
convinced
us
that
the
supposed
enemy
was
no
other
than
our
old
friend
the
grand
turk
she
did
not
appear
to
know
us
for
no
sooner
did
she
see
that
our
craft
was
a
brig
of
war
than
supposing
us
to
belong
to
johnny
bull
she
crowded
all
her
canvas
and
made
the
best
of
her
way
off
knowing
what
she
was
we
permitted
her
to
escape
without
further
alarm
the
first
land
we
made
was
cape
mount
the
natives
came
off
to
a
considerable
distance
in
their
canoes
clothed
in
nothing
but
a
piece
of
cloth
fastened
round
the
waist
and
extending
downward
to
the
feet
as
we
approached
the
shore
we
saw
several
fires
burning
this
we
were
told
in
the
broken
english
spoken
by
our
sable
visitors
was
the
signal
for
trade
we
bought
a
quantity
of
oranges
limes
cocoanuts
tamarinds
plantains
yams
and
bananas
we
likewise
took
in
a
quantity
of
cassava
a
species
of
ground
root
of
which
we
made
tolerable
pudding
and
bread
also
a
few
hogs
and
some
water
we
lay
here
several
days
looking
out
for
any
english
vessels
that
might
come
thither
for
purposes
of
trade
meanwhile
we
began
to
experience
the
inconvenience
of
a
hot
climate
our
men
were
all
covered
with
blotches
or
boils
probably
occasioned
by
so
sudden
a
transition
from
extreme
cold
to
extreme
heat
what
was
worse
than
this
was
the
want
of
a
plentiful
supply
of
water
in
the
absence
of
this
we
were
placed
on
an
allowance
of
two
quarts
per
diem
to
each
man
this
occasioned
us
much
suffering
for
after
mixing
our
indian
for
puddings
our
cassava
for
bread
and
our
whisky
for
grog
we
had
but
little
left
to
assuage
our
burning
thirst
some
in
their
distress
drank
large
quantities
of
sea
water
which
only
increased
their
thirst
and
made
them
sick
others
sought
relief
in
chewing
lead
tea-leaves
or
anything
which
would
create
moisture
never
did
we
feel
more
delighted
than
when
our
boat’s
crew
announced
the
discovery
of
a
pool
of
fine
clear
water
we
received
it
with
greater
satisfaction
than
ever
prodigal
did
tidings
of
the
death
of
some
rich
old
relative
to
whose
well-laden
purse
he
was
undisputed
heir
we
could
have
joined
in
the
most
enthusiastic
cold-water
song
ever
sung
by
either
hermit
or
washingtonian.[21
while
cruising
along
the
coast
we
one
night
perceived
a
large
ship
lying
at
anchor
near
the
shore
we
could
not
decide
whether
she
was
a
large
merchantman
or
a
man
of
war
so
we
approached
her
with
the
utmost
caution
our
doubts
were
soon
removed
for
she
suddenly
loosed
all
her
sails
and
made
chase
after
us
by
the
help
of
their
glasses
our
officers
ascertained
her
to
be
an
english
frigate
of
course
it
was
folly
to
engage
her
so
we
made
all
the
sail
we
could
carry
beat
to
quarters
lighted
our
matches
and
lay
down
at
our
guns
expecting
to
be
prisoners
of
war
before
morning
during
the
night
we
hung
out
false
lights
and
altered
our
course
this
baffled
our
pursuer
in
the
morning
she
was
no
more
to
be
seen
the
next
sail
we
made
was
not
so
formidable
she
was
an
english
vessel
at
anchor
in
the
senegal
river
we
approached
her
and
hailed
her
officer
returned
an
insolent
reply
which
so
exasperated
our
captain
that
he
passed
the
word
to
fire
into
her
but
recalled
it
almost
immediately
the
countermand
was
too
late
for
in
a
moment
everything
being
ready
for
action
we
poured
a
whole
broadside
into
our
unfortunate
foe
the
current
carried
us
away
from
the
stranger
we
attempted
to
beat
up
again
but
our
guns
had
roused
the
garrison
in
a
fort
which
commanded
the
river
they
began
to
blaze
away
at
us
in
so
expressive
a
manner
that
we
found
it
prudent
to
get
a
little
beyond
the
reach
of
their
shot
and
patiently
wait
for
daylight
the
next
morning
we
saw
our
enemy
hauled
close
in
shore
under
the
protection
of
the
fort
and
filled
with
soldiers
at
first
it
was
resolved
to
man
the
boats
and
cut
her
out
but
this
after
weighing
the
subject
maturely
was
pronounced
to
be
too
hazardous
an
experiment
and
notwithstanding
our
men
begged
to
make
the
attempt
it
was
wisely
abandoned
how
many
were
killed
by
our
hasty
broadside
we
never
learned
but
doubtless
several
poor
fellows
were
hurried
to
a
watery
and
unexpected
grave
affording
another
illustration
of
the
beauty
of
war
this
affair
our
men
humorously
styled
the
battle
of
senegal
after
visiting
cape
three
points
we
shaped
our
course
for
st
thomas
on
our
way
we
lost
a
prize
through
a
display
of
yankee
cunning
in
her
commander
we
had
hoisted
english
colors
the
officer
in
command
of
the
stranger
was
pretty
well
versed
in
the
secrets
of
false
colors
and
in
return
he
ran
up
the
american
flag
the
bait
took
supposing
her
to
be
american
we
showed
the
stars
and
stripes
this
was
all
the
merchantman
desired
it
told
him
what
we
were
and
he
made
all
possible
sail
for
st
thomas
we
followed
crowding
every
stitch
of
canvas
our
brig
could
carry
we
also
got
out
our
sweeps
and
swept
her
along
but
in
vain
the
merchantman
was
the
better
sailer
and
succeeded
in
reaching
st
thomas
which
being
a
neutral
port
secured
her
safety
her
name
was
the
jane
of
liverpool
the
next
morning
another
liverpool
merchantman
got
into
the
harbor
unseen
by
our
look-out
until
she
was
under
the
protection
of
the
laws
of
neutrality
our
next
business
was
to
watch
the
mouth
of
the
harbor
in
the
hope
of
catching
them
as
they
left
port
but
they
were
too
cautious
to
run
into
danger
especially
as
they
were
expecting
a
convoy
for
their
protection
which
might
make
us
glad
to
trust
more
to
our
canvas
than
to
our
cannon
shortly
after
this
occurrence
we
made
another
sail
standing
in
towards
st
thomas
hoisting
english
colors
our
officers
also
donning
the
british
uniform
we
soon
came
near
enough
to
hail
her
for
not
doubting
that
we
were
a
british
brig
the
merchantman
made
no
effort
to
escape
us
our
captain
hailed
her
ship
ahoy
halloa
what
ship
is
that
the
ship
barton
where
do
you
belong
to
liverpool
what
is
your
cargo
red-wood
palm
oil
and
ivory
where
are
you
bound
to
to
st
thomas
just
at
that
moment
our
english
flag
was
hauled
down
and
to
the
inexpressible
annoyance
of
the
officers
of
the
barton
the
stars
and
stripes
supplied
its
place
haul
down
your
colors
continued
captain
nicholson
the
old
captain
who
up
to
this
moment
had
been
enjoying
a
comfortable
nap
in
his
very
comfortable
cabin
now
came
upon
deck
in
his
shirt
sleeves
rubbing
his
eyes
and
looking
so
exquisitely
ridiculous
it
was
scarcely
possible
to
avoid
laughing
so
surprised
was
he
at
the
unexpected
termination
of
his
dreams
he
could
not
command
skill
enough
to
strike
his
colors
which
was
accordingly
done
by
the
mate
as
they
had
two
or
three
guns
aboard
and
as
some
of
the
men
looked
as
if
they
would
like
to
fight
our
captain
told
us
if
they
fired
to
not
leave
enough
of
her
to
boil
a
tin
pot
with
after
this
expressive
and
classical
threat
we
lowered
our
boats
and
took
possession
of
this
our
first
prize
after
taking
out
as
much
of
her
cargo
as
we
desired
just
at
night
we
set
her
on
fire
it
was
an
imposing
sight
to
behold
the
antics
of
the
flames
leaping
from
rope
to
rope
and
from
spar
to
spar
until
she
looked
like
a
fiery
cloud
resting
on
the
dark
surface
of
the
water
presently
her
spars
began
to
fall
her
masts
went
by
the
board
her
loaded
guns
went
off
the
hull
was
burned
to
the
water’s
edge
and
what
a
few
hours
before
was
a
fine
trim
ship
looking
like
a
winged
creature
of
the
deep
lay
a
shapeless
charred
mass
whose
blackened
outline
shadowed
in
the
clear
still
waves
looked
like
the
grim
spirit
of
war
lurking
for
its
prey
this
wanton
destruction
of
property
was
in
accordance
with
our
instructions
to
sink
burn
and
destroy
whatever
we
took
from
the
enemy
such
is
the
war-spirit
sink
burn
and
destroy
how
it
sounds
yet
such
are
the
instructions
given
by
christian

nations
to
their
agents
in
time
of
war
what
christian
will
not
pray
for
the
destruction
of
such
a
spirit
the
crew
of
the
barton
we
carried
into
st
thomas
and
placed
them
on
board
the
jane
excepting
a
portuguese
and
two
colored
men
who
shipped
among
our
crew
we
also
took
with
us
a
fine
black
spaniel
dog
whom
the
men
called
by
the
name
of
paddy
this
done
we
proceeded
to
watch
for
fresh
victims
on
which
to
wreak
the
vengeance
of
the
war-spirit
the
next
sail
we
met
was
an
english
brig
called
the
adventure
which
had
a
whole
menagerie
of
monkeys
on
board
we
captured
and
burned
her
just
as
we
did
the
barton
her
crew
were
also
disposed
of
in
the
same
manner
one
of
them
an
african
prince
who
had
acquired
a
tolerable
education
in
england
and
who
was
remarkably
polite
and
sensible
shipped
in
the
siren
his
name
was
samuel
quaqua
we
now
remained
at
st
thomas
several
days
carrying
on
a
petty
trade
with
the
natives
our
men
bought
all
kinds
of
fruit
gold
dust
and
birds
for
these
things
we
gave
them
articles
of
clothing
tobacco
knives
c
for
an
old
vest
i
obtained
a
large
basket
of
oranges
for
a
hand
of
tobacco
five
large
cocoanuts
a
profitable
exchange
on
my
side
since
although
i
drew
my
tobacco
of
the
purser
i
fortunately
never
acquired
the
habit
of
using
it
a
loss
i
never
regretted
my
cocoanuts
were
far
more
gratifying
and
valuable
when
we
got
to
sea
parched
with
thirst
and
suffering
for
water
than
all
the
tobacco
in
the
ship
while
in
this
port
i
had
to
throw
myself
on
the
protection
of
the
officers
to
avoid
the
disposition
to
abuse
which
existed
in
one
of
the
petty
officers
several
of
these
gentlemen
who
messed
together
had
a
large
boy
to
wait
on
them
he
was
unacquainted
with
naval
usages
and
somewhat
awkward
withal
this
led
them
to
oppress
him
they
frequently
knocked
him
round
and
even
ventured
to
flog
him
with
a
rope’s-end
the
poor
lad
used
to
cry
and
fret
about
it
leading
quite
a
miserable
life
by
some
means
it
happened
that
i
was
ordered
to
take
his
place
and
i
determined
to
resist
their
habit
of
punishing
their
servant
so
one
day
when
the
gunner
came
below
for
his
share
of
the
whisky
and
found
it
was
gone
his
messmates
having
drank
the
whole
and
asked
me
for
his
whisky
i
boldly
answered
i
know
nothing
about
it
at
this
he
broke
out
into
a
furious
passion
declaring
that
if
i
did
not
find
his
whisky
he
would
have
my
heart’s
blood
to
this
dignified
and
manly
threat
i
made
no
reply
but
proceeded
forthwith
to
the
first
lieutenant
and
laid
the
facts
before
him
the
gunner
was
sent
for
reprimanded
and
threatened
with
degradation
if
ever
he
either
struck
or
offered
to
strike
me
again
of
course
i
had
no
further
trouble
with
these
would-be
tyrants
the
only
other
difficulty
i
ever
had
on
board
the
siren
was
with
a
young
midshipman
who
was
on
his
first
voyage--who
was
in
sailor’s
language
a
real
green-horn
he
ordered
me
one
day
to
wash
his
clothes
i
refused
saying
it
was
not
my
duty
putting
on
the
air
of
a
pompous
man
he
told
me
it
was
my
duty
to
obey
an
officer
and
i
should
do
it
i
persisted
in
resisting
this
sprig
of
american
aristocracy
and
as
i
heard
no
more
of
it
i
suppose
he
learned
that
he
was
in
the
wrong
the
effect
of
my
conduct
on
the
gunner
was
seen
a
short
time
afterwards
in
the
following
little
incident
which
will
also
show
the
reader
the
nature
of
the
pranks
practised
in
men
of
war
by
the
hands
the
gunner
was
a
very
selfish
man
and
somehow
when
we
were
on
short
allowance
of
water
he
contrived
to
keep
a
keg
filled
which
he
kept
in
a
small
state-room
and
a
man
might
choke
before
he
would
part
with
a
drop
one
night
when
my
throat
was
parched
with
thirst
i
met
the
boatswain’s
mate
and
said
if
i
were
minded
to
play
the
rogue
i
could
hook
some
water
the
mate
who
was
as
dry
as
myself
looked
mightily
gratified
at
this
piece
of
news
and
asked
where
i
have
a
key
that
will
fit
the
lock
of
the
room
where
the
gunner
keeps
his
water
keg
well
said
he
give
me
the
key
i
will
be
the
rogue
while
you
keep
watch
for
the
old
gunner
after
drinking
all
we
desired
we
locked
the
door
and
returned
to
our
posts
wondering
how
the
gunner
would
feel
when
he
found
that
some
one
had
been
practising
the
arithmetical
rule
called
reduction
on
his
water
keg
the
next
day
the
offended
gunner
threw
out
sundry
hints
to
his
messmates
about
his
loss
indirectly
charging
them
with
the
robbery
this
drew
down
their
wrath
upon
him
and
he
was
compelled
to
be
content
with
swallowing
his
choler
and
getting
a
new
lock
for
his
state-room
in
all
his
rage
he
never
uttered
a
word
to
me
he
had
not
forgotten
my
appeal
to
his
superiors
from
st
thomas
we
proceeded
to
angola
where
we
staid
long
enough
to
clean
paint
and
refit
our
brig
from
stem
to
stern
this
was
the
last
port
we
intended
to
touch
at
on
the
coast
of
africa
our
next
anchorage
was
to
be
in
boston
harbor--at
least
so
we
purposed
but
providence
and
the
british
ordered
it
otherwise
to
accomplish
our
object
we
had
to
run
the
gauntlet
through
the
host
of
english
cruisers
that
hovered
about
like
birds
of
prey
along
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
coast
this
enterprise
appeared
so
impossible
to
my
mind
while
we
lay
at
angola
and
the
fear
of
being
retaken
and
hung
operated
so
strongly
on
my
imagination
that
more
than
once
i
determined
to
run
away
and
find
a
refuge
among
the
africans
but
my
better
judgment
prevailed
at
last
and
i
continued
at
my
post
still
i
used
every
possible
precaution
to
escape
detection
in
case
of
our
capture
in
accordance
with
the
custom
of
our
navy
at
that
period
i
let
my
hair
grow
long
behind
to
change
my
looks
more
effectually
instead
of
tying
mine
in
a
cue
as
the
others
did
i
let
it
hang
in
ringlets
all
round
my
face
and
neck
this
together
with
the
effect
of
time
caused
me
to
appear
quite
a
different
lad
from
what
i
was
when
a
boy
on
board
the
macedonian
i
also
adopted
that
peculiarity
of
dress
practised
by
american
men-of-war’s-men
which
consisted
in
wearing
my
shirt
open
at
the
neck
with
the
corners
thrown
back
on
these
corners
a
device
was
wrought
consisting
of
the
stars
of
the
american
flag
with
the
british
flag
underneath
by
these
means
i
hoped
to
pass
for
a
genuine
yankee
without
suspicion
in
case
we
should
fall
into
english
hands
having
finished
our
preparations
we
left
angola
for
boston
we
reached
the
island
of
ascension
in
safety
where
was
a
post-office
of
a
truly
patriarchal
character
a
box
is
nailed
to
a
post
near
the
shore
ships
that
pass
send
to
the
box
and
deposit
or
take
out
letters
as
the
case
may
be
this
is
probably
the
cheapest
general
post-office
establishment
in
the
world
we
had
scarcely
left
this
island
before
the
cry
of
sail
ho
arrested
every
ear
supposing
her
to
be
a
large
merchantman
we
made
towards
her
but
a
nearer
approach
made
it
doubtful
whether
she
was
an
indiaman
or
a
man
of
war
the
captain
judged
her
to
be
the
latter
and
tacked
ship
immediately
he
was
unwilling
to
place
himself
in
the
situation
of
an
american
privateer
who
mistaking
a
seventy-four
for
a
merchantman
ran
his
ship
close
alongside
and
boldly
summoned
her
to
haul
down
her
colors
the
captain
of
the
other
ship
coolly
replied
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
striking
my
colors
at
the
same
moment
the
ports
of
his
ship
were
opened
and
disclosed
her
long
ranges
of
guns
yawning
over
the
decks
of
the
privateer
perceiving
his
mistake
the
privateer
with
admirable
tact
and
good
humor
said
well
if
you
won’t
i
will
and
pulling
down
his
bunting
surrendered
to
his
more
powerful
foe
to
avoid
such
a
mistake
as
this
our
captain
made
all
sail
to
escape
the
coming
stranger
which
was
now
bearing
down
upon
us
under
a
heavy
pressure
of
canvas
revealing
as
she
gained
upon
our
little
brig
that
she
bore
the
formidable
character
of
a
seventy-four
gun
ship
under
english
colors
of
course
fighting
was
out
of
the
question
it
would
be
like
the
assault
of
a
dog
on
an
elephant
or
a
dolphin
on
a
whale
we
therefore
crowded
all
possible
sail
threw
our
guns
cables
anchors
hatches
c
overboard
to
increase
her
speed
but
it
soon
became
apparent
that
we
could
not
escape
the
wind
blew
quite
fresh
which
gave
our
opponent
the
advantage
she
gained
on
us
very
fast
we
shifted
our
course
in
hopes
to
baffle
her
until
night
when
we
felt
pretty
sure
of
getting
out
of
her
way
it
was
of
no
use
she
still
gained
until
we
saw
ourselves
almost
within
gun-shot
of
our
opponent
in
this
extremity
the
captain
ordered
the
quartermaster
george
watson
to
throw
the
private
signals
overboard
this
was
a
hard
task
for
the
bold-hearted
fellow
as
he
pitched
them
into
the
sea
he
said
good-bye
brother
yankee
an
expression
which
in
spite
of
their
mortifying
situation
forced
a
smile
from
the
lips
of
the
officers
the
sound
of
a
gun
now
came
booming
through
the
air
it
was
a
signal
for
us
to
heave
to
or
to
look
out
for
consequences
what
might
have
been
we
learned
afterwards
for
a
division
of
the
crew
of
the
seventy-four
had
orders
to
sink
us
if
we
made
the
least
show
of
resistance
finding
it
useless
to
prolong
the
chase
our
commander
reluctantly
ordered
the
flag
to
be
struck
we
then
hove
to
and
our
foe
came
rolling
down
upon
us
looking
like
a
huge
avalanche
rushing
down
the
mountain
side
to
crush
some
poor
peasant’s
dwelling
her
officers
stood
on
her
quarter
deck
glancing
unutterable
pride
while
her
captain
shouted
what
brig
is
that
the
united
states
brig
siren
replied
captain
nicholson
this
is
his
britannic
majesty’s
ship
medway_!”[22
he
answered
i
claim
you
as
my
lawful
prize
boats
were
then
lowered
the
little
brig
taken
from
us
and
our
crew
transferred
to
the
medway
stowed
away
in
the
cable
tier
and
put
in
messes
of
twelve
with
an
allowance
of
only
eight
men’s
rations
to
a
mess
a
regulation
which
caused
us
considerable
suffering
from
hunger
the
sight
of
the
marines
on
board
the
medway
made
me
tremble
for
my
fancy
pointed
out
several
of
them
as
having
formerly
belonged
to
the
macedonian
i
really
feared
i
was
destined
to
speedily
swing
at
the
yard-arm
it
was
however
a
groundless
alarm
this
event
happened
july
12
1814
only
eight
days
before
we
had
celebrated
the
independence
of
our
country
by
dancing
and
splicing
the
main-brace
now
we
had
a
fair
prospect
of
a
rigorous
imprisonment
such
are
the
changes
which
constantly
occur
under
the
rule
of
the
war-spirit
the
day
subsequent
to
our
capture
we
were
marched
to
the
quarter
deck
with
our
clothes-bags
where
we
underwent
a
strict
search
we
were
ordered
to
remove
our
outside
garments
for
this
purpose
they
expected
to
find
us
in
possession
of
large
quantities
of
gold
dust
what
little
our
crew
had
purchased
was
taken
from
them
with
a
spirit
of
rapacity
altogether
beneath
the
dignity
of
a
naval
commander
our
short
allowance
was
a
source
of
much
discomfort
in
this
our
prison-ship
but
in
the
true
spirit
of
sailors
we
made
even
this
a
subject
of
coarse
jests
and
pleasant
remark
some
would
sit
and
paint
the
luxuries
of
shore
life
until
our
mouths
watered
at
the
idea
of
soft
tack
fried
eggs
sausages
and
those
other
delicacies
which
go
to
make
up
a
sailor’s
idea
of
a
sensual
paradise
others
would
discourse
about
roast
beef
boiled
lamb
and
caper
sauce
to
which
some
old
weather-beaten
tar
would
answer
give
me
the
lamb
and
a
knife
and
fork
and
i
will
cut
capers
enough
this
would
draw
out
peals
of
laughter
to
be
followed
by
various
yarns
of
feasts
gone
by
and
of
sprees
enjoyed
on
liberty
and
paydays
thus
we
beguiled
our
time
though
with
all
our
laughing
we
could
not
laugh
away
the
clamors
of
our
hungry
stomachs
and
when
i
took
my
turn
of
a
few
minutes
on
deck
the
gift
of
a
piece
of
hard
dry
biscuit
afforded
me
more
gustatory
delight
than
would
the
taste
of
the
richest
pound-cake
now
that
i
have
an
abundance
of
food
enduring
this
evil
we
proceeded
on
our
course
when
the
medway
arrived
at
simon’s
town
about
twenty-one
miles
from
the
cape
of
good
hope
we
met
the
denmark
seventy-four
on
her
way
to
england
with
prisoners
from
cape
town
the
captain
had
hitherto
intended
to
land
us
at
the
latter
place
but
the
presence
of
the
denmark
led
him
to
change
his
purpose
and
land
us
at
simon’s
town
the
journey
from
this
place
to
the
cape
was
one
of
great
suffering
to
our
crew
we
were
received
on
the
beach
by
a
file
of
irish
soldiers
under
their
escort
we
proceeded
seven
miles
through
heaps
of
burning
sand
seeing
nothing
worthy
of
notice
on
the
way
but
a
number
of
men
busily
engaged
in
cutting
up
dead
whales
on
the
sea-shore
after
resting
a
short
time
we
recommenced
our
march
guarded
by
a
new
detachment
of
soldiers
unused
to
walking
as
we
were
we
began
to
grow
excessively
fatigued
and
after
wading
a
stream
of
considerable
depth
we
were
so
overcome
that
it
seemed
impossible
to
proceed
any
farther
we
lay
down
discouraged
and
wretched
on
the
sand
the
guard
brought
us
some
bread
and
gave
half-a-pint
of
wine
to
each
man
this
revived
us
somewhat
we
were
now
placed
under
a
guard
of
dragoons
they
were
very
kind
and
urged
us
to
attempt
the
remaining
seven
miles
to
relieve
us
they
carried
our
clothes-bags
on
their
horses
and
overtaking
some
dutch
farmers
going
to
the
cape
with
broom-stuff
and
brush
the
officer
of
the
dragoons
made
them
carry
the
most
weary
among
us
in
their
wagons
it
is
not
common
for
men
to
desire
the
inside
of
a
prison
but
i
can
assure
my
readers
we
did
most
heartily
wish
ourselves
there
on
that
tedious
journey
at
last
about
nine
o’clock
p
m
we
arrived
at
cape
town
having
left
one
of
our
number
at
wineburg
through
exhaustion
who
joined
us
the
next
day
stiff
sore
and
weary
we
hastily
threw
ourselves
on
the
hard
boards
of
our
prison
where
without
needing
to
be
soothed
or
rocked
we
slept
profoundly
until
late
the
next
morning
for
a
description
of
our
prison
with
what
happened
to
us
there
the
reader
is
referred
to
the
succeeding
chapter
chapter
x
the
next
morning
we
took
a
survey
of
our
new
quarters
we
found
ourselves
placed
in
a
large
yard
surrounded
by
high
walls
and
strongly
guarded
by
soldiers
within
this
inclosure
there
was
a
building
or
shed
composed
of
three
rooms
neither
of
which
had
any
floor
round
the
sides
stood
three
benches
or
stages
one
above
the
other
to
serve
for
berths
on
these
we
spread
our
hammocks
and
bed-clothes
making
them
tolerably
comfortable
places
to
sleep
in
a
few
of
the
men
preferred
to
sling
their
hammocks
as
they
did
at
sea
here
also
we
used
to
eat
unless
as
was
our
frequent
practice
we
did
so
in
the
open
air
our
officers
had
been
sent
thirty
miles
inland
so
that
we
had
lost
the
natural
exactors
of
discipline
among
seamen
to
remedy
this
deficiency
our
first
step
was
to
adopt
a
set
of
regulations
in
respect
to
order
cleanliness
c
and
to
appoint
certain
of
our
number
to
enforce
them
we
experienced
some
unpleasantness
at
first
from
the
insolence
of
some
of
the
sergeants
commanding
the
prison
guard
most
of
these
petty
officers
were
very
friendly
and
kind
but
two
or
three
of
them
manifested
a
surly
tyrannical
temper
annoying
us
in
many
little
things
enough
to
embitter
our
enjoyment
while
they
were
on
duty
this
petty
despotism
we
soon
cured
by
returning
their
abuse
in
a
rather
provoking
kind
of
coin
we
used
to
plague
them
by
causing
a
long
delay
when
the
hour
arrived
for
them
to
be
relieved
they
were
required
to
muster
us
every
morning
that
we
might
be
counted
before
the
new
guard
took
us
in
charge
on
those
occasions
some
would
purposely
absent
themselves
others
were
sent
to
find
the
absentees
these
in
their
turn
would
hide
themselves
and
require
to
be
sought
by
others
this
was
excessively
vexatious
to
the
soldiers
and
as
it
occurred
only
when
a
tyrannical
sergeant
was
on
guard
they
soon
understood
its
meaning
the
plan
was
successful
and
we
thus
got
rid
of
one
source
of
discomfort
our
next
difficulty
was
with
the
old
dutchman
named
badiem
who
furnished
our
prison
with
provisions
he
had
already
learned
the
difficulty
of
cheating
a
yankee
for
the
americans
who
were
carried
away
in
the
denmark
had
been
in
this
same
prison
and
had
taught
the
old
man
that
they
were
rougher
customers
than
the
frenchmen
who
had
preceded
them
we
gave
him
another
lesson
he
undertook
to
wrong
us
and
benefit
himself
by
furnishing
a
very
inferior
article
of
bread
after
counselling
among
ourselves
we
took
the
following
plan
to
bring
him
to
his
senses
we
were
visited
every
day
by
a
superior
officer
called
the
officer
of
the
day
he
was
a
kind
old
man
who
had
seen
service
in
the
war
of
the
revolution
and
was
at
the
battle
of
bunker
hill
he
had
a
profound
respect
for
the
american
character
and
could
not
speak
of
that
great
action
without
tears
one
day
a
friendly
sergeant
being
on
duty
we
gave
him
a
piece
of
the
old
dutchman’s
bread
complaining
bitterly
of
its
quality
when
the
old
officer
came
round
as
usual
on
a
fine
dashing
charger
and
asked
his
customary
question
of
all
right
our
friend
the
sergeant
replied
no
sir
what
is
the
matter
asked
the
venerable
old
gentleman
the
prisoners
complain
of
their
bread
sir
said
the
sergeant
let
me
see
it
answered
the
general
the
sergeant
gave
him
a
small
piece
he
examined
it
wrapped
it
up
carefully
in
some
paper
clapped
the
spurs
to
his
horse
and
rode
off
the
next
day
we
had
better
bread
than
ever
before
and
an
order
came
for
a
man
from
each
room
to
go
with
the
sentry
to
the
town
every
morning
to
examine
our
daily
provision
and
if
not
what
it
should
be
to
reject
it
this
completely
upset
the
golden
visions
of
the
old
dutchman
with
much
choler
he
exclaimed
i
had
rather
have
one
tousand
frenchmen
than
one
hundred
yankees
we
could
not
now
complain
of
our
fare
we
had
an
abundance
of
beef
and
mutton
beside
a
full
allowance
of
bread
c
the
beef
to
be
sure
was
poor
lean
stuff
but
the
mutton
was
excellent
the
sheep
at
the
cape
have
a
peculiarity
which
may
cause
the
reader
to
smile
they
have
enormously
large
flat
tails
weighing
from
twelve
to
twenty
pounds
these
are
regularly
sold
by
the
pound
for
purposes
of
cookery
should
any
one
treat
this
statement
as
a
forecastle
yarn
i
refer
him
to
the
descriptions
of
these
sheep
given
by
travellers
and
naturalists.[23
besides
our
prison
allowance
we
had
opportunity
to
purchase
as
many
little
luxuries
and
niceties
as
our
slender
finances
would
permit
these
were
furnished
by
a
slave
who
was
the
property
of
the
old
dutchman
and
who
was
so
far
a
favorite
as
to
be
indulged
with
two
wives
and
the
privilege
of
selling
sundry
small
articles
to
the
prisoners
this
sable
polygamist
furnished
us
with
coffee
made
from
burnt
barley
for
a
doublegee
an
english
penny)[24
per
pint
the
same
sum
would
purchase
a
sausage
a
piece
of
fish
or
a
glass
of
rum
on
equally
reasonable
terms
he
furnished
us
with
blackberries
oranges
c
our
men
who
by
the
way
had
eaten
fruit
in
every
quarter
of
the
globe
and
were
therefore
competent
judges
pronounced
the
latter
the
best
in
the
world
the
berries
afforded
me
a
rich
treat
at
christmas
to
obtain
means
for
the
purchase
of
these
dainties
our
men
braided
hats
wrought
at
mechanical
employments
or
at
such
pursuits
as
their
respective
tastes
and
capacities
suggested
these
occupations
served
to
beguile
our
confinement
of
much
of
its
tediousness
still
we
had
many
vacant
listless
hours
to
fill
them
we
resorted
to
the
demoralizing
practice
of
gambling
a
game
with
balls
called
shake-bag
loo
venture
all-fours
c
occupied
our
evening
hours
and
sometimes
the
whole
night
it
was
not
uncommon
for
the
game
to
be
protracted
beyond
the
midnight
hour
of
saturday
into
the
sacred
moments
of
the
holy
sabbath
on
one
of
these
guilty
mornings
some
of
us
on
retiring
to
a
shed
found
the
dead
body
of
a
black
slave
hanging
by
the
rope
with
which
in
a
moment
of
unpardonable
despair
he
had
committed
the
horrid
crime
of
suicide
the
hour
the
scene
the
place
our
recent
guilty
profanation
of
god’s
holy
day
conspired
to
fill
many
of
us
with
profound
dread
in
my
own
mind
it
led
to
a
few
transient
purposes
of
amendment
alas
when
the
bright
sun
arose
these
purposes
had
vanished
the
influence
of
vice
triumphed
i
grew
more
and
more
hardened
in
wickedness
cape
town
contained
a
large
slave
population
these
poor
wretches
had
been
extremely
degraded
under
the
rule
of
the
dutch
it
was
said
that
their
condition
had
been
essentially
improved
since
the
conquest
of
the
place
by
the
english
still
as
the
suicide
just
mentioned
demonstrated
slavery
was
a
bitter
draught
the
british
have
done
wisely
since
then
in
granting
freedom
to
the
slaves
in
all
their
colonies
may
the
whole
world
imitate
the
noble
example
we
were
subjected
to
frequent
and
violent
gales
of
wind
while
here
the
approach
of
these
storms
was
always
faithfully
proclaimed
by
the
mountain
that
towered
up
behind
us
a
large
white
cloud
resting
on
its
summit
like
a
tablecloth
was
a
certain
indication
of
the
elemental
warfare
whenever
this
phenomenon
appeared
our
men
used
to
remark
look
out
for
a
blow
the
cloth
is
beginning
to
spread
very
soon
the
vessels
in
the
bay
could
be
seen
striking
their
top-gallant
masts
and
yards
and
sometimes
even
housing
their
top-masts
in
a
few
minutes
the
ocean
would
give
signs
of
the
coming
commotion
the
waves
became
crested
with
clouds
of
foam
and
the
spirit
of
the
storm
was
seen
careering
in
triumph
over
the
liquid
mountains
of
the
angry
deep
besides
table
mountain
there
was
another
near
it
called
the
lion’s
rump
from
its
similarity
to
that
noble
animal
in
a
sitting
posture
on
the
summit
of
this
mountain
was
a
telegraph
which
informed
us
in
common
with
the
people
of
the
cape
of
the
approach
of
shipping
to
the
harbor
at
the
town
the
british
had
a
hospital
for
the
accommodation
of
their
army
and
navy
the
advantages
of
this
institution
were
humanely
and
properly
offered
to
us
whenever
we
were
sick
happening
to
be
quite
unwell
one
day
my
shipmates
advised
me
to
go
thither
now
on
board
the
siren
when
in
a
similar
state
the
surgeon
had
administered
an
ounce
of
glauber
salts
the
dose
caused
such
nausea
that
from
that
time
i
held
salts
in
profound
abhorrence
when
the
hospital
was
suggested
to
me
i
associated
it
with
the
idea
of
salts
and
shuddering
remarked
that
i
would
go
if
i
thought
they
would
not
give
me
salts
my
shipmates
all
said
they
thought
i
should
not
have
salts
prescribed
so
under
the
guard
of
a
sentry
i
sallied
forth
to
the
hospital
well
my
boy
said
the
doctor
what’s
the
matter
with
you
with
many
wry
faces
i
told
him
my
symptoms
when
to
my
inconceivable
mortification
and
disgust
he
spoke
to
a
sort
of
lob-lolly
boy
who
waited
upon
him
and
said
doctor
jack
bring
this
boy
six
ounces
of
salts
this
was
intolerable
one
ounce
had
sickened
me
for
months
at
the
bare
mention
of
salts
and
now
i
was
to
swallow
six
it
seemed
impossible
the
remedy
was
worse
than
the
disease
i
wished
myself
back
at
my
quarters
this
was
however
in
vain
unless
i
took
a
dangerous
leap
from
the
window
i
must
submit
the
salts
were
brought
but
they
were
not
so
bad
either
in
quality
or
quantity
as
my
dose
in
the
siren
the
reason
i
found
to
consist
in
the
fact
that
they
were
epsom
instead
of
glauber
and
that
the
six
ounces
included
the
weight
of
the
water
in
which
they
were
dissolved
so
well
was
i
pleased
with
my
visit
to
the
hospital
and
especially
with
the
privilege
afforded
me
of
walking
about
the
streets
of
cape
town
that
i
afterwards
feigned
illness
to
gain
another
admission
i
was
willing
to
take
the
salts
for
the
sake
of
the
liberty
of
jaunting
about
the
streets
of
the
sin
of
lying
i
thought
nothing
i
was
a
sailor
caring
little
for
aught
but
present
gratification
the
beauty
of
truth
i
had
never
seen
the
hatefulness
of
a
lie
i
had
never
learned
most
gratefully
do
i
acknowledge
that
divine
goodness
which
has
since
effectually
taught
me
both
the
one
and
the
other
at
cape
town
there
was
a
small
prison
called
the
trunk
to
this
place
those
of
our
number
who
were
disorderly
were
sent
to
be
closely
confined
on
no
other
diet
than
bread
and
water
for
as
many
days
as
the
commandant
might
designate
we
always
quietly
permitted
any
offender
among
us
to
be
sent
thither
without
resistance
but
when
on
one
occasion
an
attempt
was
made
to
confine
two
of
our
shipmates
unjustly
we
gave
them
a
demonstration
which
saved
us
afterwards
from
any
similar
attempt
two
of
our
men
had
hung
out
some
clothes
they
had
just
washed
in
our
yard
near
their
own
shed
now
it
happened
that
the
doctor
to
the
military
stationed
at
the
cape
had
an
entrance
to
his
office
through
our
yard
the
clothes
were
undesignedly
hung
across
his
path
compelling
him
either
to
stoop
a
little
in
passing
or
to
ask
their
removal
he
was
too
proud
to
adopt
either
of
these
peaceful
methods
but
with
manifest
spitefulness
he
took
out
his
knife
and
cut
the
line
so
that
the
clothes
fell
into
the
dirt
the
owners
seeing
their
wet
clothing
in
this
condition
broke
out
into
passionate
inquiries
after
the
offender
it
was
the
english
doctor
replied
one
of
our
shipmates
who
had
witnessed
the
whole
affair
this
brought
forth
a
volley
of
sailors’
oaths
from
the
offended
parties
the
enraged
doctor
overheard
their
wrathful
ebullitions
and
without
further
ceremony
ordered
the
two
men
to
be
carried
to
the
trunk
here
then
was
a
manifest
case
of
injustice
we
resolved
not
to
submit
to
it
let
the
consequences
be
what
they
might
when
the
sergeant
came
in
for
the
doctor’s
victims
we
all
turned
out
in
a
body
declaring
we
would
all
go
to
the
trunk
together
the
sergeant
seeing
us
in
this
state
of
rebellion
called
out
the
whole
guard
and
ordered
them
to
load
and
fire
upon
us
we
were
not
however
so
easily
scared
we
shouted
fire
away
you
will
have
but
one
fire
and
then
it
will
be
our
turn
at
the
same
time
we
picked
up
all
the
broken
glass
sticks
stones
c
which
were
within
our
reach
and
stood
waiting
for
their
firing
as
the
signal
for
a
general
mêlée
the
sergeant
seeing
our
resolution
and
wisely
considering
that
our
superiority
in
numbers
might
secure
us
a
victory
over
the
handful
composing
his
guard
ordered
the
soldiers
to
retire
we
never
heard
any
more
of
the
little
doctor’s
indignation
it
probably
evaporated
like
the
moisture
from
the
clothes
his
petty
indignation
had
thrown
to
the
ground
how
insignificant
such
acts
appear
in
men
professing
to
be
gentlemen
shortly
after
this
event
we
were
thrown
into
confusion
and
temporary
excitement
by
the
approach
of
a
large
party
to
our
prison
at
midnight
attended
by
a
band
of
music
we
turned
out
and
rushed
to
the
gate
of
our
yard
the
guard
turned
out
likewise
trembling
under
the
impression
that
our
countrymen
had
captured
the
town
and
were
coming
to
give
us
our
liberty
their
fears
and
our
wonder
were
quieted
however
by
a
speedy
discovery
of
the
true
character
of
this
midnight
party
it
was
a
dutch
wedding
coming
to
the
house
of
the
old
dutchman
our
caterer
the
entrance
to
which
being
in
our
yard
the
party
had
to
pass
directly
through
our
territories
which
they
did
their
band
playing
the
tune
of
a
free
and
accepted
mason
notwithstanding
we
were
in
tolerably
comfortable
circumstances
our
confinement
soon
became
exceedingly
irksome
we
pined
for
freedom
we
longed
to
get
once
more
where
the
old
gridiron
floated
in
fearless
triumph
a
report
of
the
burning
of
washington
by
the
british
added
not
a
little
to
our
desire
we
began
to
talk
of
home
this
led
to
other
suggestions
these
to
the
formation
of
plans
for
our
escape
we
at
length
concerted
a
measure
which
was
to
break
from
the
prison
in
the
night
disarm
and
confine
the
guard
help
ourselves
to
boats
and
cut
out
some
large
ship
in
which
we
might
make
our
escape
to
america
the
success
of
this
plot
however
was
never
tested
for
reaching
the
ears
of
the
commander
the
guards
were
strengthened
the
light
dragoons
ordered
out
to
patrol
the
harbor
and
such
other
preventive
measures
adopted
as
cut
off
all
hope
of
forcible
escape
our
only
remedy
for
this
disappointment
was
submission
and
boasting
of
what
we
would
have
done
had
we
got
into
the
strife
for
liberty
as
the
period
of
our
imprisonment
drew
towards
a
close
we
were
informed
that
the
rev
george
thom
a
missionary
was
desirous
to
come
and
preach
to
us
some
of
our
men
objected
because
they
said
he
would
preach
about
his
king
and
they
had
no
desire
to
hear
anything
about
kings
others
said
let
him
come
we
will
hear
him
with
attention
and
if
we
don’t
like
him
we
can
afterwards
stay
away
at
any
rate
don’t
let
us
abuse
him
but
rather
show
him
that
americans
know
what
is
good
behavior
this
reply
shows
the
true
spirit
of
the
mass
of
seamen
in
respect
to
religion
for
though
they
care
little
about
personal
piety
they
will
not
usually
unless
intoxicated
insult
a
minister
this
was
once
shown
in
the
experience
of
the
eccentric
rowland
hill
when
a
mob
threatened
the
old
gentleman
with
mischief
some
sailors
present
rallied
round
him
threatening
vengeance
on
any
who
dared
to
insult
the
preacher
accordingly
we
sent
our
respects
to
mr
thom
inviting
him
to
favor
us
with
a
visit
we
then
cleaned
and
fitted
up
one
room
with
benches
the
following
sabbath
he
came
his
preaching
was
earnest
simple
and
interesting
instead
of
discoursing
about
kings
as
some
had
predicted
the
only
king
about
whom
he
preached
was
the
king
of
heaven
we
invited
him
to
come
again
he
accepted
the
invitation
and
our
meetings
soon
began
to
be
profitable
and
interesting
we
had
singing
for
several
of
our
men
were
tolerable
singers
and
they
were
aided
by
the
presence
of
some
pious
soldiers
from
the
garrison
and
occasionally
by
mrs
thom
the
amiable
lady
of
our
excellent
preacher
our
officers
too
frequently
came
from
their
residence
and
were
pleased
to
see
the
good
order
and
happiness
apparent
on
these
occasions
i
assure
my
readers
that
the
most
delightful
moments
of
our
imprisonment
were
those
we
spent
in
singing
some
sweet
hymn
in
the
good
old-fashioned
tunes
of
bridgewater
russia
wells
c
among
the
texts
used
by
mr
thom
i
remember
the
following
turn
ye
to
the
strong-hold
ye
prisoners
of

behold
i
stand
at
the
door
and
knock
c
rev

and
yet
there
is
room
luke
xiv

it
was
really
pleasing
to
hear
the
various
remarks
made
by
our
men
after
listening
to
faithful
discourses
from
these
and
similar
texts
one
would
remark
he
hit
me
a
clew
to
this
another
would
reply
he
shot
away
my
colors
a
third
would
add
he
shot
away
my
rigging
while
a
fourth
would
say
he
gave
me
a
shot
and
a
fifth
he
gave
me
a
broadside
thus
in
their
rough
way
did
they
express
the
impressions
made
on
their
minds
by
the
discourse
mr
thom
was
a
faithful
servant
of
his
master
the
lord
jesus
christ
he
did
not
rest
satisfied
with
these
public
efforts
but
during
the
week
he
visited
us
for
the
purpose
of
serious
conversation
several
of
us
were
really
under
strong
conviction
and
would
confess
at
these
inquiry
meetings
and
to
each
other
as
we
paced
the
yard
how
often
we
had
sinned
even
cursing
our
maker
when
on
the
yard
at
night
amid
the
roaring
of
the
storm
the
bellowing
of
the
thunder
and
the
angry
flashing
of
the
lightning
a
happy
practical
effect
followed
gambling
ceased
cards
and
shake-bag
lost
their
charms
the
time
was
spent
in
reading
useful
books
bibles
and
religious
books
were
given
or
loaned
to
us
among
these
were
baxter’s
call
doddridge’s
rise
and
progress
of
religion
c
to
some
extent
we
were
altered
men
had
we
remained
much
longer
under
these
gracious
influences
most
of
us
i
think
would
have
become
experimental
christians
as
it
was
the
seed
was
not
wholly
wasted
impressions
were
made
which
no
doubt
have
in
many
cases
yielded
rich
fruit
long
before
this
my
own
mind
was
strongly
wrought
upon
a
singular
dream
added
to
my
seriousness
in
my
dream
i
saw
myself
drowning
while
a
fierce-looking
soldier
was
pointing
his
loaded
musket
at
my
head
thus
death
threatened
me
from
two
sources
in
this
extremity
my
anguish
was
very
great
all
my
gracious
opportunities
passed
before
me
but
now
it
seemed
too
late
for
salvation
oh
thought
i
in
my
sleep
what
would
i
give
if
this
were
only
a
dream
how
faithfully
would
i
serve
the
lord
when
i
awoke
just
at
that
moment
i
did
awake
scarcely
able
to
convince
myself
that
the
ideal
scene
was
not
an
awful
reality
that
day
i
eagerly
sought
the
missionary
and
sat
with
serious
delight
listening
to
his
instructions
still
i
did
not
give
myself
up
to
the
service
of
christ
so
difficult
was
it
for
me
to
make
the
requisite
sacrifice
of
my
beloved
sins
just
at
this
interesting
crisis
a
glad
report
of
peace
between
england
and
america
reached
our
prison
with
joyful
faces
we
assembled
round
the
good
man
when
he
came
that
day
to
inquire
if
it
was
really
so
while
he
assured
us
of
its
truth
he
mildly
asked
if
it
was
peace
with
heaven
assuring
us
that
it
was
a
matter
of
the
greatest
importance
for
us
to
be
at
peace
with
god
as
a
memento
of
our
esteem
for
mr
thom
we
made
him
several
little
presents
one
of
them
was
a
hat
made
from
a
bullock’s
horn
the
horn
was
peeled
into
narrow
slips
these
were
scraped
split
and
braided
like
straw
and
then
sewed
together
we
also
made
him
a
model
of
a
ship
fully
rigged
from
stem
to
stern
the
missionary
received
these
marks
of
our
regard
with
evident
pleasure
and
no
doubt
when
looking
upon
them
afterwards
offered
many
a
prayer
for
the
salvation
of
the
prisoners
who
were
for
many
weeks
the
subjects
of
his
anxiety
and
labors
blessings
rest
on
him
if
he
yet
lives
peace
to
his
ashes
if
he
slumbers
among
the
dead
great
was
the
joy
of
my
companions
when
the
news
reached
us
that
we
were
to
embark
shortly
in
the
cumberland
seventy-four
for
england
little
was
now
said
or
done
except
what
related
to
our
departure
with
strange
yet
common
perversity
of
conduct
serious
matters
were
laid
aside
for
the
one
absorbing
thought
we
shall
soon
be
free
thus
an
event
which
should
have
given
birth
to
gratitude
and
religious
service
only
served
for
an
occasion
of
further
neglect
and
unthankfulness
how
strangely
wicked
is
the
human
heart
for
myself
the
tidings
filled
me
with
fear
directly
to
america
i
would
have
gladly
gone
but
to
be
carried
to
england
in
one
of
her
ships
of
war
was
like
going
to
certain
death
how
was
it
possible
for
me
to
escape
detection
how
could
i
avoid
meeting
with
some
old
macedonians
who
would
of
course
recognise
and
betray
me
these
questions
had
resolved
me
to
volunteer
to
remain
at
the
cape
a
short
time
before
when
some
of
our
number
were
sent
to
england
now
they
tortured
me
beyond
endurance
i
felt
like
an
escaped
criminal
with
the
officers
of
justice
at
his
heels
death
at
the
yard-arm
haunted
me
day
and
night
like
the
fancied
ghost
of
a
murdered
man
staring
ghastly
at
the
window
of
his
murderer
no
one
can
imagine
my
uneasiness
unless
he
has
been
placed
in
a
similar
situation
i
made
many
promises
to
god
that
if
he
would
carry
me
in
safety
to
america
i
would
cease
to
be
a
swearer
and
would
most
punctually
attend
his
house
every
sabbath
these
things
constituted
my
highest
ideas
of
human
duty
at
that
time
but
even
these
promises
like
those
made
during
the
heat
of
the
battle
in
the
macedonian
were
made
to
be
broken
after
a
little
delay
we
were
conveyed
on
board
the
cumberland
where
we
soon
heard
the
well-known
summons
of
all
hands
up
anchor
ahoy
a
cloud
of
canvas
dropped
from
her
gigantic
yards
the
sportive
breeze
came
obedient
to
our
wish
and
the
huge
form
of
the
cumberland
accompanied
by
a
large
convoy
of
merchant
vessels
was
borne
rapidly
along
upon
the
yielding
waves
cape
town
table
mountain
the
lion’s
rump
and
our
prison-yard
were
soon
left
far
behind
leaving
no
traces
of
their
existence
on
the
distant
horizon
they
were
to
be
known
to
us
hereafter
only
among
the
images
of
the
brain--as
recollections
not
as
realities
we
had
spent
eight
months
in
the
prison
of
cape
town
our
treatment
in
this
ship
was
superior
to
what
we
received
in
the
medway
instead
of
the
cable
tier
we
had
berths
on
the
upper
gun
deck
and
our
allowance
of
food
was
sufficient
for
our
wants
arriving
at
st
helena
we
remained
a
few
days
in
port
this
rough
rock-bound
island
had
not
yet
received
its
future
prisoner
the
emperor
of
france
here
we
were
removed
from
the
cumberland
twenty-four
of
us
were
sent
on
board
the
grampus
of
fifty
guns
the
rest
were
sent
home
in
our
old
conqueror
the
medway
my
lot
being
cast
among
the
former
this
transfer
to
the
grampus
greatly
alarmed
me
since
the
more
men
i
saw
the
greater
of
course
was
my
chance
of
detection
i
had
already
escaped
being
known
on
board
of
two
seventy-fours
but
i
could
not
promise
myself
the
same
impunity
much
longer
however
as
i
saw
no
one
whose
face
was
familiar
when
i
went
on
board
i
felt
a
little
more
easy
but
that
night
i
had
occasion
for
great
trepidation
and
alarm
about
nine
o’clock
i
heard
the
order
from
an
officer
of
pass
the
word
for
the
boy
leech
this
was
followed
by
several
voices
hallooing
boy
leech
boy
leech
my
heart
beat
like
a
trip-hammer
against
my
bosom
and
a
cold
sweat
crept
over
my
whole
body
my
shipmates
said
they
meant
me
but
i
would
not
reply
after
a
few
moments
i
breathed
more
freely
and
the
fear
of
death
passed
away
i
heard
some
one
saying
your
master
wants
you
which
convinced
me
that
there
was
a
boy
leech
among
the
crew
of
the
grampus
as
well
as
another
boy
leech
among
the
american
prisoners
on
our
passage
we
made
a
strange
sail
coming
up
to
her
to
our
infinite
satisfaction
we
beheld
the
stars
and
stripes
at
her
mast-head
brother
jonathan
has
come
to
town
said
one
of
our
men
he
is
a
most
welcome
visitor
the
rest
replied
for
indeed
the
old
gridiron
never
looked
so
pleasant
as
it
did
then
this
meeting
confirmed
us
in
the
report
of
peace
between
the
two
nations
this
was
as
gratifying
to
the
crew
of
the
grampus
as
to
us
for
they
had
recently
heard
that
the
war
with
france
was
ended
and
they
were
all
hoping
to
get
discharged
this
expectation
was
defeated
however
by
intelligence
from
some
passing
ship
that
napoleon
was
at
paris
again
with
a
force
of
sixty
thousand
men
nothing
could
exceed
the
joy
of
the
officers
and
the
vexation
of
the
crew
at
this
piece
of
information
the
former
dreaded
a
peace
because
it
would
place
many
of
them
on
half-pay
while
the
chances
of
war
inspired
them
with
hopes
of
promotion
hence
they
ran
alongside
almost
every
ship
in
the
fleet
shouting
have
you
heard
the
news
bonaparte
has
got
to
paris
with
sixty
thousand
men
really
some
of
them
seemed
crazy
with
joy
at
the
idea
of
protracted
war
not
so
however
the
seamen
they
longed
for
peace
since
war
only
brought
them
hard
usage
wounds
and
death
while
therefore
the
officers
were
rejoicing
they
were
muttering
curses
and
oaths
wishing
bonaparte
and
his
army
at
perdition
nor
was
it
strange
that
they
felt
thus
for
the
discipline
on
board
the
grampus
was
excessively
severe
they
were
constantly
flogging
in
the
most
harsh
and
cruel
manner
the
sirens
were
astonished
at
what
they
saw
for
on
board
our
brig
we
seldom
saw
more
than
a
dozen
lashes
inflicted
at
one
time
and
that
not
very
often
at
last
we
came
in
sight
of
the
white
cliffs
of
old
england
to
avoid
suspicion
i
appeared
much
interested
in
everything
i
saw
on
the
coast
and
asked
the
men
all
those
questions
which
are
natural
to
a
stranger
when
he
sees
a
new
country
for
the
first
time
these
inquiries
they
answered
with
the
utmost
good
humor
for
an
englishman
is
proud
of
his
country
notwithstanding
he
may
find
hard
usage
from
her
hands
my
american
friends
have
frequently
asked
if
my
language
did
not
excite
suspicion
that
i
was
english
it
never
did
to
my
knowledge
indeed
so
free
was
i
from
english
provincialisms
that
it
was
often
remarked
to
me
that
i
needed
no
protection
meaning
that
i
should
be
taken
for
a
yankee
without
offering
proof
with
all
this
in
my
favor
i
could
not
behold
myself
approaching
my
native
soil
without
many
misgivings
to
a
man
who
knows
a
halter
is
hanging
over
his
head
everything
furnishes
cause
for
alarm
a
piercing
look
a
whisper
or
the
sudden
mention
of
his
name
is
a
cause
of
disquietude
sufficient
to
stir
his
inmost
soul
captain
nicholson
gave
me
no
little
uneasiness
by
sending
for
me
one
day
just
before
we
arrived
in
port
to
make
some
inquiries
about
mr
crowninshield
of
salem
mass
luckily
i
could
say
i
had
seen
him
beyond
that
i
could
give
no
further
information
he
supposed
me
to
be
a
native
of
salem
while
i
was
quaking
through
a
fearful
expectation
of
being
found
nearly
as
ignorant
of
that
city
as
i
had
been
on
another
occasion
of
the
city
of
philadelphia
at
length
we
reached
spithead
and
were
removed
to
an
old
prison-ship
called
the
puissant
which
had
once
belonged
to
the
french
here
we
were
treated
with
great
lenity
we
were
even
allowed
liberty
to
go
on
shore
had
i
dared
i
would
have
run
away
the
dread
of
the
halter
restrained
me
i
did
not
even
venture
to
write
lest
my
mother
should
be
tempted
to
visit
me
or
even
to
write
since
even
a
letter
from
any
place
in
england
might
awaken
suspicion
concerning
my
true
character.[25
after
a
stay
of
several
weeks
in
the
old
puissant
orders
came
for
our
transfer
to
the
rover
a
gun-brig
which
had
orders
to
carry
us
to
plymouth
here
was
a
double
risk
again
before
me
i
had
to
risk
being
known
by
the
crew
of
the
rover
and
by
the
many
persons
who
had
known
me
at
plymouth
however
the
good
hand
of
providence
was
with
me
to
preserve
me
we
reached
our
port
in
safety
where
to
our
great
delight
we
heard
that
the
woodrop
simms
of
philadelphia
was
to
be
the
cartel
to
convey
us
to
america
before
we
were
allowed
to
tread
her
decks
however
we
had
to
spend
two
or
three
days
on
board
the
royal
sovereign
of
one
hundred
and
ten
guns
because
the
woodrop
simms
was
not
quite
ready
to
receive
us
here
i
was
exposed
to
the
gaze
of
eight
hundred
men
but
none
of
them
knew
me
indeed
this
was
my
most
hazardous
situation
for
the
sovereign
and
macedonian
had
sailed
in
company
before
the
capture
of
the
latter
whenever
any
of
her
men
came
near
our
quarters
i
endeavored
to
look
cross-eyed
or
closed
one
eye
so
as
to
appear
partially
blind
and
in
various
other
ways
altered
my
appearance
so
that
even
an
old
shipmate
would
have
been
puzzled
to
recognise
me
at
first
at
last
the
grateful
news
reached
us
that
the
cartel
was
ready
we
went
on
board
with
great
gaiety
where
we
met
our
shipmates
who
had
left
the
cape
before
us
they
had
been
confined
in
the
celebrated
dartmoor
prison
with
a
number
of
other
prisoners
where
they
had
met
with
rather
rough
treatment
and
rougher
fare
they
were
present
at
what
they
called
the
massacre
several
of
the
prisoners
were
detected
in
an
effort
to
escape
to
strike
terror
into
the
poor
victims
captain
shortland
ordered
his
men
to
fire
in
upon
them
quite
a
number
were
killed
and
more
wounded
by
this
cold-blooded
act
the
rest
sought
the
shelter
of
the
prison
walls
several
americans
suffered
in
this
wanton
assault
our
meeting
at
this
juncture
was
a
source
of
mutual
gratulation
our
ship
was
now
surrounded
with
boats
containing
provisions
of
all
descriptions
to
our
surprise
the
dartmoor
men
bought
freely
of
everything
where
they
obtained
their
money
we
could
not
imagine
we
learned
afterwards
that
their
stock
consisted
of
counterfeit
coins
manufactured
by
the
prisoners
it
was
well
for
them
that
our
ship
put
to
sea
before
john
bull’s
peace
officers
received
information
of
the
fraud
what
a
school
for
every
species
of
vice
is
opened
by
war
the
corruptions
and
vices
occasioned
by
the
operation
of
this
system
are
beyond
the
power
of
the
imagination
to
conceive
my
feelings
were
peculiar
as
i
beheld
my
native
land
receding
from
my
vision
i
was
happy
and
yet
sad
happy
because
i
was
now
safe
sad
because
i
was
again
leaving
the
soil
which
held
my
mother
and
my
friends
on
the
whole
my
joyous
feelings
prevailed
a
few
days
out
we
were
hailed
by
an
english
frigate
she
sent
a
boat
alongside
to
make
some
inquiries
and
left
us
to
pursue
our
way
in
peace
we
were
all
in
good
spirits
our
men
being
divided
into
watches
to
assist
the
crew
of
the
ship
our
officers
all
snugly
quartered
in
the
cabin
and
myself
appointed
to
assist
the
steward
an
office
quite
agreeable
to
one
who
had
lived
on
prisoners’
fare
more
than
a
year,[26
because
it
brought
me
a
few
of
the
spare
luxuries
from
the
officers’
table
one
morning
shortly
after
the
english
frigate
had
boarded
us
captain
nicholson
asked
me
something
about
salem
i
smiled
he
inquired
why
i
laughed
sir
said
i
salem
is
not
my
native
place
by
considerable
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
captain
looking
somewhat
puzzled
at
my
manner
of
treating
the
subject
i
then
unfolded
the
secret
of
my
having
been
one
of
the
crew
captured
in
the
macedonian
they
seemed
amazed
at
the
risks
i
had
encountered
since
the
capture
of
the
siren
and
congratulated
me
very
warmly
on
my
really
hair-breadth
escape
from
the
halter
it
was
a
fortunate
escape
indeed
for
which
i
can
never
be
sufficiently
thankful
to
that
all-seeing
eye
that
watched
for
my
safety
in
the
moment
of
peril
during
this
voyage
a
great
deal
was
said
about
quitting
the
seas
and
settling
down
in
quietness
ashore
one
of
our
shipmates
named
william
carpenter
who
belonged
to
rhode
island
had
a
particular
enthusiasm
in
favor
of
farming
he
promised
to
take
me
with
him
where
i
could
learn
the
art
of
cultivating
the
soil
many
of
us
made
strong
resolutions
to
embark
in
some
such
enterprise
the
pleasures
of
agriculture
were
sung
and
praised
among
us
in
so
ardent
a
manner
that
he
must
have
been
incredulous
indeed
who
could
have
doubted
for
a
moment
the
certainty
of
quite
a
number
of
our
hands
becoming
farmers
whenever
we
should
gain
the
land
one
night
we
lay
in
our
hammocks
talking
with
great
earnestness
about
our
favorite
scheme
the
wind
blowing
quite
freshly
on
deck
said
one
if
i
ever
get
home
you
won’t
catch
me
on
board
of
a
ship
again
yes
said
another
farmers
live
well
at
any
rate
they
are
not
put
on
allowance
but
have
enough
to
eat
if
they
work
hard
all
day
they
can
turn
in
at
night
and
if
it
blows
hard
the
house
won’t
rock
much
and
there’s
no
sails
to
reef
while
this
and
similar
conversation
was
going
on
the
wind
was
blowing
harder
and
harder
from
occasional
heavy
puffs
it
at
last
grew
to
be
a
tremendous
gale
hearing
so
much
wind
though
there
were
hands
enough
on
deck
to
manage
the
ship
some
of
us
got
up
to
assist
if
we
were
needed
it
was
now
blowing
most
fearfully
the
wild
howling
and
whistling
among
the
rigging
the
wilder
roar
of
the
angry
sea
the
hallooing
of
the
captain
and
the
impenetrable
darkness
which
lent
its
horrors
to
the
scene
were
appalling
even
to
a
sailor’s
breast
just
as
i
stepped
upon
deck
she
shipped
a
heavy
sea
which
drenched
me
to
the
skin
presently
we
heard
the
crash
of
falling
timbers
and
away
went
a
top-mast
and
a
yard
in
the
slings
there
were
now
so
many
men
on
deck
that
we
were
in
each
other’s
way
some
of
us
went
below
and
turned
in
with
the
full
expectation
that
our
ship
would
founder
before
morning
and
thinking
it
would
be
as
well
to
go
down
in
our
hammocks
as
on
deck
while
this
state
of
gloomy
foreboding
continued
some
of
my
shipmates
manifested
great
alarm
about
eternity
they
prayed
aloud
in
deep
distress
others
only
cursed
and
said
as
if
in
bravado
we
are
all
going
to
hell
together
for
my
own
part
i
kept
repeating
the
lord’s
prayer
and
renewing
those
promises
so
often
made
in
the
moment
of
apparent
destruction
at
length
the
day
dawned
revealing
the
sad
havoc
made
by
the
winds
of
our
masts
and
rigging
we
also
saw
a
number
of
those
dwellers
on
the
ocean
called
mother
carey’s
chickens
our
shattered
aspect
reminded
me
of
the
macedonian
after
the
battle
excepting
that
we
had
no
wounded
and
dead
about
us
now
captain
jones
who
had
not
left
the
deck
a
moment
during
the
night
declared
that
though
he
had
been
twenty-five
years
at
sea
he
had
never
witnessed
such
a
gale
before
our
ship
was
nearly
new
and
an
excellent
sea-boat
or
she
would
have
shared
the
fate
of
many
a
ship
in
that
terrible
gale
as
the
wind
abated
with
the
approach
of
day
we
repaired
our
damages
and
proceeded
on
our
voyage
frequently
passing
vessels
which
had
suffered
as
severely
as
ourselves
this
gale
was
on
the
9th
and
10th
days
of
august
1815
probably
many
both
sailors
and
landsmen
will
recollect
this
and
the
september
gale
of
that
year
which
occasioned
such
destruction
of
life
and
shipping
sailors
are
superstitious
our
men
attributed
this
mishap
to
the
presence
of
some
jonah
in
the
ship
the
man
they
pitched
upon
as
the
probable
offender
was
an
old
sea-captain
who
had
been
cast
away
several
times
that
he
had
done
some
fearful
deed
was
a
matter
of
undoubted
truth
among
them
but
not
being
so
resolute
as
the
mariners
of
tarshish
they
did
not
cast
him
into
the
sea
neither
did
this
liberality
on
their
part
cost
us
our
lives
for
after
several
days
of
pleasant
weather
we
one
morning
found
ourselves
safely
anchored
at
the
quarantine
ground
near
the
city
of
new
york
the
crew
of
the
siren
having
obtained
leave
to
go
on
shore
full
of
my
good
purposes
to
lead
a
steady
life
on
the
land
i
hurried
directly
to
broadway
to
inquire
for
my
former
employer
the
kind-hearted
boot-maker
to
my
disappointment
he
had
gone
to
philadelphia
so
that
i
returned
on
board
somewhat
chagrined
at
the
failure
of
my
plan
the
next
morning
we
were
conveyed
in
a
large
sail-boat
on
board
the
tom
bowling
an
hermaphrodite
brig
here
i
was
congratulated
by
the
old
quartermaster
lewis
deal
who
was
with
me
when
we
narrowly
escaped
capture
at
the
mouth
of
salem
harbor
while
on
a
fishing
excursion
he
said
he
had
felt
much
anxiety
for
my
safety
all
the
voyage
especially
as
it
was
reported
that
my
former
captain
had
made
strict
search
for
the
macedonians
among
all
the
american
prisoners
who
were
carried
to
england
the
kind-hearted
old
man
wept
tears
of
gladness
at
my
safe
return
while
we
staid
in
the
tom
bowling
the
september
gale
mentioned
above
took
place
we
were
right
glad
as
it
broke
its
fury
over
our
anchorage
in
vain
to
think
we
were
so
safely
housed
in
a
good
harbor
instead
of
being
exposed
to
its
wrath
on
the
deep
many
a
brave
heart
perished
in
that
memorable
storm
the
two
years
having
expired
for
which
we
shipped
we
were
paid
off
with
the
sum
of
one
hundred
dollars
i
hurried
on
shore
and
deposited
my
funds
in
the
hands
of
my
landlord
at
a
sailor’s
boarding-house
now
followed
a
life
of
dissipation
and
folly
the
grave
resolutions
passed
at
sea
to
settle
down
as
steady
farmers
vanished
into
air
drinking
swearing
gambling
going
to
the
theatre
and
other
kindred
vices
took
up
all
our
time
as
long
as
our
money
lasted
our
religious
vows
were
equally
slighted
and
forgotten
instead
of
being
better
we
became
worse
than
ever
we
felt
as
if
new
york
belonged
to
us
and
that
we
were
really
the
happiest
jolliest
fellows
in
the
world
for
my
own
part
i
fell
deeper
into
wickedness
than
ever
before
drinking
swearing
and
gambling
as
i
had
never
done
on
any
former
occasion
how
could
it
be
otherwise
who
cared
for
the
sailor
then
not
one
he
was
left
to
his
own
depraved
heart’s
promptings
bethels
and
religious
boarding-houses
did
not
then
throw
their
genial
influences
round
his
path
to
charm
his
footsteps
to
the
shrines
of
virtue
and
religion
near
the
very
spot
where
the
bethel
church
now
stands
in
new
york
i
have
frequently
gambled
for
hours
with
a
bottle
of
spirits
on
the
table
uncaring
and
uncared
for
by
any
human
being
thrice
blessed
be
the
man
who
first
established
bethels
and
temperance
boarding-houses
they
are
the
sailor’s
life-boats
which
snatch
him
from
the
gory
jaws
of
the
unprincipled
landsharks
who
fatten
on
his
ruin
sometimes
in
a
sober
moment
i
thought
i
would
break
away
from
this
wicked
mode
of
life
i
even
engaged
myself
to
a
boot-maker
to
complete
my
knowledge
of
his
business
but
the
dread
of
the
confinement
to
the
shoe-bench
which
my
riotous
fancy
painted
as
being
worse
than
a
prison
drove
me
from
my
purpose
and
left
me
still
among
my
shipmates
at
last
my
landlord
told
me
my
money
was
all
expended
and
that
i
must
look
out
for
something
to
do
my
shipmates
were
in
a
similar
dilemma
their
number
decreasing
every
day
as
one
after
another
shipped
in
the
various
merchant
vessels
preparing
for
sea
alas
for
our
farmers
in
perspective
their
dreams
of
ploughing
the
land
evaporated
leaving
them
what
they
were
before
and
what
most
of
them
remained
until
death
the
ploughmen
of
the
ocean
my
landlord’s
gentle
hint
put
a
stop
to
my
excesses
for
the
very
sufficient
reason
that
it
was
attended
with
a
protest
on
my
further
checks
for
funds
for
a
while
i
found
employment
in
loading
and
unloading
ships
and
in
assisting
to
fit
them
for
sea
but
this
proving
an
uncertain
employment
i
was
induced
to
join
a
number
of
my
fellow-boarders
in
going
to
the
rendezvous
of
the
united
states
brig
boxer
here
we
shipped
for
two
years
more
i
was
then
eighteen
years
of
age
and
was
rated
as
an
ordinary
seaman
with
ten
dollars
per
month
wages
behold
me
then
dear
reader
once
more
on
board
a
man
of
war
in
spite
of
all
the
dangers
i
had
escaped
and
the
promises
i
had
made
to
risk
myself
no
more
on
the
ocean
the
next
chapter
will
unfold
the
events
which
transpired
while
i
sailed
in
the
boxer
chapter
xi
on
shipping
in
the
boxer
i
received
three
months’
advance
which
excepting
a
small
sum
expended
for
clothing
fell
into
the
hands
of
my
rapacious
landlord
how
much
this
gentleman
contrived
to
filch
from
me
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
say
but
that
he
was
well
paid
i
have
no
doubt
he
had
my
hundred
dollars
my
advance
all
i
earned
for
working
on
the
wharves
and
nine
dollars
beside
which
i
obtained
from
the
purser
all
this
according
to
his
account
i
spent
in
a
few
weeks
with
the
exception
of
a
very
small
sum
laid
out
for
clothing
as
i
had
no
means
of
proving
his
statements
false
there
was
no
alternative
but
submission
and
a
return
to
a
life
of
toil
and
danger
to
earn
a
fresh
supply
as
the
method
by
which
i
obtained
the
nine
dollars
above
mentioned
from
the
purser
will
exhibit
one
of
the
modes
in
which
seamen
are
sometimes
cheated
i
will
relate
it
while
in
the
siren
i
drew
but
half
my
allowance
of
grog
by
the
rules
of
the
service
i
could
claim
the
balance
in
money
this
i
overlooked
when
we
were
paid
off
but
when
my
funds
got
low
it
came
into
my
mind
i
proposed
to
some
of
the
boys
who
had
a
similar
claim
to
visit
the
purser
they
only
laughed
at
me
and
said
it
would
be
of
no
use
for
he
would
not
pay
it
now
we
were
discharged
finding
they
would
not
join
me
i
went
alone
to
the
city
hotel
where
the
purser
boarded
and
inquired
for
him
of
the
bar-tender
he
came
down
stairs
and
i
spread
out
my
complaint
before
him
he
blustered
and
said
i
had
no
such
claim
allowed
i
insisted
and
told
him
it
was
my
right
and
he
must
pay
it
hoping
to
get
rid
of
me
he
told
me
to
call
again
the
next
day
this
i
did
when
he
paid
me
nine
dollars
this
will
show
the
reader
one
of
the
ways
in
which
poor
jack
is
plundered
and
that
too
by
gentlemen
the
boxer
lay
at
the
navy
yard
whither
we
were
conducted
the
vacillation
of
a
seaman’s
character
was
illustrated
before
we
got
on
board
by
one
of
our
hands
running
away
another
went
a
little
beyond
the
first
he
went
on
board
where
he
pretended
to
lose
his
hat
overboard
begging
permission
to
recover
it
he
seized
the
rope
which
fastened
the
boat
to
the
shore
dropped
over
the
stern
into
the
boat
and
pushing
up
to
the
wharf
leaped
ashore
and
made
off
such
fickle-mindedness
is
not
uncommon
among
sailors
we
lost
another
of
our
crew
in
a
more
melancholy
manner
he
was
in
my
mess
an
englishman
by
birth
who
had
just
left
a
british
vessel
to
enter
the
american
service
he
was
at
work
on
the
main
yard
and
by
some
means
or
other
losing
his
foothold
he
fell
unfortunately
he
struck
a
carronade
screw
in
his
descent
which
inflicted
a
terrible
wound
the
poor
man
suffered
excruciating
agonies
for
a
short
time
and
died
we
buried
him
on
shore
in
a
plain
coffin
without
form
or
ceremony
such
are
the
contingencies
which
wait
to
hurry
seamen
to
the
grave
we
were
kept
busily
at
work
upon
the
brig
for
some
time
after
which
our
commander
captain
porter
came
on
board
we
soon
found
him
to
belong
rather
to
the
race
of
fitzroys
and
cardens
than
to
that
of
decaturs
parkers
or
nicholsons
he
was
inclined
to
tyranny
and
severe
discipline
he
soon
gave
us
a
specimen
of
his
character
in
a
most
illegal
act
of
punishment
we
lay
alongside
the
hornet
or
peacock
i
forget
which
it
happened
that
her
captain
and
most
of
her
officers
were
gone
ashore
one
day
our
captain
accidentally
saw
one
of
her
men
engaged
in
some
act
of
misconduct
instead
of
entering
a
complaint
against
the
man
to
his
own
officers
he
ordered
him
to
be
seized
up
and
severely
flogged
notwithstanding
the
earnest
entreaties
of
the
offender
for
pardon
why
the
captain
of
that
vessel
did
not
call
captain
porter
to
an
account
for
this
manifest
invasion
of
his
prerogatives
i
never
knew
for
we
put
to
sea
shortly
afterwards
an
officer
who
would
thus
gratuitously
volunteer
his
services
to
punish
a
man
must
be
a
tyrant
at
heart
so
at
least
we
thought
while
many
misgivings
concerning
the
future
troubled
our
minds
as
i
was
now
rated
an
ordinary
seaman
and
not
a
boy
as
heretofore
i
had
a
station
assigned
me
in
the
fore-top
instead
of
being
a
servant
to
any
of
the
officers
i
was
also
appointed
to
be
one
of
the
crew
of
the
captain’s
gig
this
made
my
lot
one
of
more
fatigue
and
exposure
than
in
any
former
voyage
a
proof
of
which
i
very
soon
experienced
it
being
now
late
in
the
fall
the
weather
became
very
cold
one
afternoon
the
pennant
having
got
foul
of
the
royal
mast
an
officer
ordered
me
to
go
up
and
clear
it
i
had
no
mittens
on
it
took
me
some
time
to
perform
my
task
and
before
i
came
down
one
of
my
fingers
was
frozen
thus
it
is
however
with
the
poor
tar
and
he
thinks
himself
happy
to
escape
his
dangers
with
injuries
so
slight
as
this
the
disposition
of
our
commanding
officer
was
still
further
revealed
to
my
discomfort
one
day
while
we
were
at
work
on
the
cables
something
i
did
not
happening
to
suit
him
he
gave
me
a
severe
blow
on
the
head
with
his
fist
not
far
from
the
place
where
i
had
been
previously
injured
by
the
malice
of
the
malay
boy
this
unmanly
blow
occasioned
me
violent
pains
for
several
days
since
that
time
i
have
felt
a
peculiar
hostility
to
a
practice
which
is
lamentably
common
in
some
schools
and
families
i
mean
that
of
rapping
children
on
the
head
with
a
thimble
or
with
the
knuckles
or
anything
else
the
practice
is
the
result
of
irrational
passion
it
is
dangerous
and
cannot
therefore
be
too
severely
reprobated
if
it
is
pleaded
as
necessary
to
enforce
obedience
and
ensure
respect
i
know
it
will
fail
of
such
effects
it
will
only
excite
feelings
of
revenge
ill-will
and
malice
we
now
received
sailing
orders
and
were
very
soon
under
weigh
bound
to
the
balize
at
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
on
this
passage
we
had
further
opportunities
of
learning
the
character
of
our
officers
although
captain
porter
was
stern
and
severe
yet
he
never
used
bad
language
he
always
spoke
with
the
utmost
deliberation
but
with
such
obvious
indications
of
feeling
that
we
often
trembled
to
hear
his
voice
most
of
the
other
officers
were
by
no
means
novitiates
in
the
art
of
swearing
but
our
sailing-master
exceeded
all
the
rest
in
this
diabolical
habit
whenever
it
was
his
watch
on
deck
he
exercised
his
voice
and
practised
the
use
of
his
choice
and
varied
vocabulary
of
oaths
by
hallooing
and
threatening
the
men
continually
whenever
we
had
to
set
on
sail
or
to
reef
he
was
especially
diligent
in
these
matters
mingling
with
his
curses
threats
of
the
lash
to
those
who
were
tardy
or
whose
movements
did
not
exactly
suit
his
taste
if
such
officers
could
only
apprehend
the
profound
contempt
and
bitter
hatred
with
which
they
are
regarded
by
their
maddened
crew
they
would
both
tremble
for
safety
and
despise
their
own
littleness
of
soul
no
really
great
man
would
enact
the
childish
vagaries
of
a
petty
tyrant
there
was
one
respect
in
which
we
were
more
annoyed
in
the
boxer
than
i
had
been
in
the
macedonian
in
this
latter
ship
none
but
the
captain
could
order
a
man
to
be
flogged
in
the
boxer
the
lieutenant
or
the
officer
of
the
watch
could
send
a
man
to
the
gangway
and
order
the
boatswain
to
lay
on
with
a
rope’s-end
this
is
a
liberty
which
the
laws
of
the
navy
should
prohibit
a
man
should
be
secured
the
rights
of
a
citizen
as
well
on
the
planks
as
on
the
soil
of
his
country
true
it
may
be
said
severity
of
discipline
is
necessary
to
good
order
in
a
ship
not
severity
but
strictness
is
what
is
wanted
let
a
strict
discipline
be
enforced
with
pleasant
looks
and
a
hurrah
my
lads
bear
a
hand
and
obedience
will
be
more
prompt
and
more
perfect
than
when
every
order
is
accompanied
with
a
damn
you
and
with
an
exhibition
of
the
rope’s-end
or
cat-o’-nine-tails
common
sense
as
well
as
experience
will
sustain
this
opinion
while
these
matters
were
passing
on
board
our
little
brig
was
dashing
through
the
waves
in
fine
style
we
arrived
at
the
balize
from
whence
we
dropped
down
to
ship
island
where
we
took
in
water
a
share
of
this
severe
task
fell
to
my
lot
for
i
was
here
taken
out
of
the
gig
and
placed
in
the
jolly-boat
to
make
way
for
a
smaller
and
lighter
lad
in
the
former
we
obtained
our
water
by
digging
large
holes
in
the
sand
into
which
we
placed
our
casks
the
salt
water
by
passing
through
so
much
sand
would
be
so
thoroughly
filtrated
that
by
the
time
it
reached
our
casks
it
was
fit
for
use
we
then
emptied
it
into
ten-gallon
kegs
called
breakers
which
we
carried
on
our
shoulders
to
the
boat
this
of
itself
was
hard
work
but
we
had
certain
tormentors
on
this
island
which
made
it
a
task
of
much
suffering
these
were
hosts
of
hungry
gigantic
moschetos
which
assailed
our
persons
and
especially
our
naked
feet
in
flying
squadrons
with
a
ferocity
that
indicated
an
uncontrollable
thirst
for
blood
but
even
these
were
not
our
worst
persecutors
they
were
attended
by
armies
of
large
yellow
horseflies
which
our
men
called
gallinippers
these
merciless
insect
savages
were
always
sure
to
attack
the
very
spot
we
had
rubbed
sore
after
the
bite
of
a
moscheto
their
bite
felt
like
the
thrust
of
a
small
sword
i
still
retain
scars
on
my
feet
occasioned
by
these
fierce
gallinippers
this
island
bore
marks
of
the
battle
of
new
orleans
for
we
found
various
articles
bearing
the
broad
arrow
and
stamped
g
r
we
also
remarked
several
mounds
which
had
the
appearance
of
being
large
graves
we
afterwards
learned
that
this
was
the
place
where
the
british
brought
their
dead
after
their
unsuccessful
attack
on
the
city
of
new
orleans
from
ship
island
we
proceeded
to
new
orleans
this
was
a
laborious
passage
the
current
ran
down
the
river
with
amazing
force
bearing
huge
logs
on
its
bosom
which
if
suffered
to
strike
either
our
bows
or
cables
were
capable
of
doing
much
damage
to
avoid
them
required
no
trifling
exertions
sometimes
we
endeavored
to
track
her
or
draw
her
along
with
ropes
as
canal-boats
are
drawn
by
horses
but
as
this
brought
us
into
shallow
water
it
was
abandoned
the
banks
of
the
river
displayed
large
numbers
of
alligators
luxuriating
on
the
numerous
logs
that
were
fast
in
the
mud
we
made
many
attempts
to
get
near
enough
to
these
scaly
monsters
to
pierce
them
with
a
boat-hook
but
they
kept
too
sharp
a
look-out
for
us
invariably
diving
into
the
stream
before
our
boat
got
near
enough
for
us
to
strike
them
but
if
we
failed
in
capturing
alligators
we
obtained
an
abundance
of
palm-leaf
from
the
shore
with
which
we
furnished
ourselves
with
hats
an
instance
of
our
commander’s
tyranny
occurred
while
we
were
ascending
the
river
he
had
requested
a
seaman
named
daily
who
was
somewhat
acquainted
with
the
river
to
act
as
pilot
by
accident
or
negligence
he
suffered
the
brig
to
strike
the
bottom
though
without
the
least
injury
the
captain
flew
into
a
passion
ordered
him
to
the
gangway
and
commanded
the
boatswain’s
mate
to
lay
on
with
his
rope’s-end
i
did
not
witness
this
flogging
for
the
hands
were
not
called
up
to
witness
punishment
unless
administered
by
the
cat-o’-nine-tails
but
one
of
my
messmates
said
that
he
received
at
least
one
hundred
lashes
i
saw
him
several
days
afterwards
with
his
back
looking
as
if
it
had
been
roasted
and
he
unable
to
stand
upright
he
wore
the
same
shirt
in
which
he
was
flogged
for
some
time
afterwards
it
was
torn
to
rags
and
showed
the
state
of
his
back
beneath
his
object
in
wearing
it
was
to
mortify
and
shame
the
captain
for
his
brutality
the
severity
of
flogging
with
the
rope’s
end
is
justly
described
in
mr
dana’s
excellent
book
called
two
years
before
the
mast
though
not
so
cruel
as
the
cat
it
is
nevertheless
a
harsh
degrading
punishment
our
men
used
to
say
that
they
would
as
lief
be
cut
up
on
the
bare
back
with
the
cat
as
have
back
and
shirt
cut
up
together
as
was
poor
daily’s
in
truth
that
flogging
was
both
unjust
and
illegal
the
articles
of
war
provide
that
not
more
than
twelve
lashes
shall
be
given
for
a
crime
but
here
one
hundred
were
inflicted
for
no
crime_--for
an
accident
which
might
have
happened
to
the
best
pilot
who
ever
ascended
the
mississippi
but
though
the
captain
was
thus
rendered
amenable
to
the
law
who
would
believe
a
poor
sailor
had
he
complained
it
would
doubtless
have
been
to
his
own
injury
for
law
and
especially
naval
law
is
always
on
the
side
of
the
strong
this
was
not
the
only
case
of
illegal
flogging
but
the
justification
of
these
excessive
whippings
was
found
in
the
pretended
existence
of
several
crimes
in
the
helpless
offenders
on
one
occasion
we
were
at
our
quarters
exercising
in
the
various
evolutions
of
war
now
at
our
guns
and
then
going
through
the
forms
of
boarding
an
enemy
now
running
aloft
as
if
in
the
act
of
cutting
down
our
enemy’s
rigging
and
then
rushing
below
as
if
to
board
her
firing
our
pistols
stabbing
with
our
boarding-pikes
and
cutting
on
all
sides
with
our
cutlasses
in
the
midst
of
this
excitement
the
movements
of
one
of
the
men
not
happening
to
please
the
captain
he
seized
a
cutlass
and
struck
him
a
tremendous
blow
with
its
flat
side
heated
with
passion
he
let
it
glance
as
he
struck
and
the
edge
entering
the
man’s
back
made
a
deep
flesh
wound
which
was
very
sore
a
long
time
some
of
our
men
swore
that
if
they
had
been
the
sufferer
they
would
have
shot
the
captain
dead
on
the
spot
are
men
of
such
brutal
tempers
fit
to
command
a
man
of
war
is
it
not
wonderful
that
mutiny
is
so
rare
under
such
a
discipline
such
an
officer
might
do
to
command
a
crew
of
pirates
but
not
of
freemen
such
as
americans
feel
proud
to
entrust
with
the
keeping
of
their
national
honor
on
the
deep
on
reaching
new
orleans
our
ship
was
overhauled
and
repaired
we
were
sent
on
board
the
louisiana
an
old
guard-ship
but
had
to
cross
the
river
every
morning
to
assist
in
working
on
the
brig
several
of
our
men
and
myself
among
them
were
quite
sick
here
owing
to
the
free
use
of
river
water
the
louisiana
had
a
number
of
men
confined
on
board
for
some
crime
they
wore
chains
round
their
legs
which
were
fastened
to
a
large
ball
the
nature
of
their
offence
i
did
not
ascertain
the
effects
of
captain
porter’s
severity
were
seen
here
in
the
loss
of
two
of
the
crew
they
belonged
to
the
gig
and
ran
away
while
he
was
on
shore
he
made
a
strict
but
unsuccessful
search
after
them
to
deter
others
from
a
like
attempt
or
because
he
wanted
an
object
on
which
to
wreak
his
vengeance
he
gave
one
poor
fellow
a
cruel
flogging
for
what
in
sober
fact
was
no
offence
at
all
the
man
was
on
shore
with
some
others
fixing
the
rigging
and
for
some
purpose
or
other
had
walked
a
short
distance
from
the
rest
without
the
slightest
intention
to
run
away
but
the
captain
wanted
a
victim
and
this
served
for
an
excuse
our
brig
being
finished
we
returned
on
board
and
were
soon
back
at
our
old
station
off
ship
island
where
we
found
several
other
small
naval
craft
while
here
i
saw
a
man
flogged
through
the
fleet
or
as
this
might
more
properly
be
called
the
squadron
his
was
the
only
instance
of
the
kind
i
saw
while
in
the
american
navy
and
although
his
back
was
most
brutally
mangled
yet
i
do
not
think
he
suffered
equal
to
those
who
are
flogged
through
an
english
fleet
still
the
indignity
and
brutality
are
the
same
in
kind
though
differing
in
degree
a
man
should
never
be
made
to
endure
it
not
far
from
our
station
at
a
place
called
st
lewis’
bay
our
captain
purchased
some
land
and
actually
sent
some
of
our
men
to
make
a
clearing
upon
it
and
to
erect
a
log
house
whether
this
was
a
legal
employment
of
the
strength
and
skill
of
his
men
or
not
i
cannot
decide
but
it
struck
me
as
being
a
perversion
of
the
national
resources
to
his
own
private
benefit
why
should
a
captain
of
a
ship
of
war
be
permitted
to
employ
the
time
and
energies
of
his
men
for
private
uses
while
an
officer
of
the
government
who
should
employ
its
funds
for
his
own
advantage
would
be
charged
with
embezzlement
and
fraud
the
cases
are
precisely
alike
except
that
one
uses
the
public
money
the
other
what
costs
that
money
it
is
a
fraud
on
the
country
and
an
imposition
on
the
men
a
tragic
event
occurred
at
lewis’
bay
on
the
4th
of
july
which
occasioned
a
fearful
sensation
throughout
the
ship
i
was
sent
thither
that
day
in
the
launch
feeling
fatigued
i
remained
with
another
in
the
boat
which
was
anchored
near
the
shore
after
some
time
one
of
the
crew
named
thomas
hill
came
back
for
a
pistol
for
there
were
several
in
the
boat
and
deliberately
charged
it
my
companion
an
old
macedonian
named
cox
asked
him
what
he
wanted
with
a
pistol
hill
who
was
a
very
desperate
fellow
told
him
to
mind
his
own
business
or
he
would
shoot
him
cox
knowing
his
character
thought
it
best
to
let
this
insult
pass
supposing
he
was
only
going
off
to
shoot
a
dog
or
snake
as
the
latter
creature
abounded
there
having
loaded
his
pistol
hill
went
off
and
we
thought
no
more
of
the
matter
presently
a
man
came
running
down
to
the
boat
to
inform
us
that
two
of
our
men
were
quarrelling
just
at
that
moment
we
heard
the
report
of
a
pistol
hurrying
to
the
spot
described
by
our
informant
we
found
a
shipmate
by
the
name
of
smith
bleeding
on
the
ground
with
a
pistol-shot
lodged
in
his
breast
by
hill
we
gathered
round
him
in
his
agony
he
begged
us
to
shoot
him
dead
for
his
suffering
was
not
to
be
endured
supposing
he
was
dying
our
testimony
to
his
statement
that
hill
was
his
murderer
was
taken
on
the
spot
the
victim
was
then
removed
to
a
suitable
place
to
be
taken
care
of
the
next
day
he
was
carried
on
board
the
brig
and
from
thence
to
a
sort
of
hospital
on
shore
where
after
lingering
a
few
days
he
died
the
murderer
was
seized
and
placed
in
irons
on
board
the
brig
he
was
afterwards
removed
to
another
ship
but
what
was
done
with
him
i
never
heard
with
certainty
it
was
reported
that
he
was
pardoned
the
cause
of
this
fatal
affray
was
that
great
instigator
of
crimes
rum
the
men
were
both
under
its
influence
fired
with
its
fumes
they
lost
all
discretion
and
commenced
a
quarrel
from
words
they
proceeded
to
blows
in
this
struggle
smith
had
the
advantage
finding
himself
worsted
the
other
ran
down
to
the
boat
for
a
pistol
with
this
he
returned
and
threatened
to
shoot
his
adversary
smith
demanded
a
pistol
for
himself
that
as
he
said
he
might
have
fair
play
at
that
instant
his
cowardly
opponent
shot
him
had
they
both
been
sober
this
tragedy
would
never
have
been
enacted
who
can
reveal
the
effects
of
alcohol
from
this
station
we
sailed
to
tampico
where
we
lay
but
a
short
time
meeting
with
nothing
worthy
of
remark
except
that
we
found
abundance
of
turtle
in
the
river
during
the
day
we
could
see
their
heads
peeping
up
from
the
river
in
all
directions
at
night
we
used
to
send
our
men
ashore
to
take
them
this
was
done
by
tracking
them
on
the
sand
whither
they
went
to
deposit
their
eggs
we
used
to
turn
them
over
on
to
their
backs
and
drag
them
down
to
the
boat
when
alongside
they
were
hoisted
on
board
with
a
tackle
some
of
them
weighing
four
or
five
hundred
weight
they
were
then
killed
and
converted
into
a
soup
for
the
whole
ship’s
company
the
day
after
we
left
tampico
on
our
passage
to
vera
cruz
i
was
looking
out
on
the
cat-head
or
starboard
bow
seeing
a
sail
i
shouted
sail
ho
when
three
other
vessels
hove
in
sight
these
were
all
patriot
privateers
so
we
were
ordered
to
our
quarters
but
the
vessels
discovering
our
character
kept
clear
of
our
guns
and
we
pursued
our
own
course
about
ten
o’clock
a
m
we
saw
two
more
of
these
privateers
crowded
with
men
but
mounting
only
one
long
gun
mistaking
us
for
a
spanish
brig
with
money
on
board
they
fired
most
lustily
for
us
to
heave
to
we
mounted
short
carronades
excepting
two
long
nines
at
the
bows
so
we
bore
down
all
hands
being
at
their
quarters
to
bring
our
short
guns
to
bear
upon
them
meanwhile
we
kept
one
of
the
long
nines
in
full
blast
i
was
stationed
at
this
gun
and
it
being
my
duty
to
sponge
and
load
i
had
to
exert
every
muscle
and
strain
every
nerve
as
firing
only
one
gun
it
was
necessary
to
discharge
it
as
often
as
possible
before
however
we
came
near
enough
to
injure
them
they
discovered
what
we
were
fired
a
leeward
gun
in
token
of
friendship
and
hauled
off
if
they
had
not
our
men
very
elegantly
observed
they
would
have
found
they
had
taken
the
wrong
pig
by
the
ear
we
soon
came
in
sight
of
the
beautiful
revolving
light
which
throws
its
friendly
beams
on
the
port
of
vera
cruz
where
as
in
the
former
places
we
lay
a
short
time
and
then
after
visiting
some
other
ports
we
returned
to
our
former
station
at
ship
island
here
however
we
remained
for
only
a
brief
period
before
we
were
under
weigh
for
new
orleans
from
which
place
we
sailed
to
havana
such
is
the
constant
change
kept
up
by
men
of
war
on
a
cruise
on
this
passage
i
was
placed
in
a
position
which
exposed
me
to
the
punishment
of
the
lash
though
by
a
mere
accident
i
escaped
there
was
a
habit
indulged
in
among
us
which
is
common
among
all
sailors
at
sea
i
mean
that
of
stealing
a
nap
during
our
watch
at
night
seated
on
the
carriage
of
a
gun
or
on
a
shot-locker
with
folded
arms
we
indulged
in
many
a
minute
of
sweet
sleep
notwithstanding
it
was
contrary
to
the
rules
of
the
ship
to
prevent
this
as
much
as
possible
the
officer
of
the
watch
used
to
give
the
first
man
he
caught
napping
a
handspike
with
which
he
was
compelled
to
walk
the
deck
until
he
found
another
sleeper
to
whom
he
was
allowed
to
transfer
his
burden
one
night
i
was
caught
dozing
and
had
to
perform
the
consequent
march
with
the
handspike
after
walking
about
without
success
in
search
of
a
sleeper
for
some
time
i
thought
it
might
be
well
to
try
my
fortune
in
the
tops
scarcely
had
i
set
foot
on
the
top
before
the
officer
below
cried
fore-top
there
sir
aloft
and
take
in
the
fore-top-gallant
sail
this
order
caused
every
man
to
spring
to
his
station
supposing
no
one
would
pass
before
the
mast
i
stood
my
handspike
upright
against
it
but
there
happened
to
be
a
man
by
the
name
of
knight
dozing
there
and
when
he
was
aroused
by
the
command
of
the
officer
he
passed
before
the
mast
to
get
on
to
the
starboard
side
as
sailors
usually
grasp
something
when
aloft
he
missed
his
hold
of
what
he
intended
to
catch
and
seized
my
handspike
which
of
course
fell
to
my
consternation
he
fell
with
it
tumbling
out
of
the
fore-top
he
fortunately
struck
the
foot-rope
of
the
fore-yard
which
broke
the
force
of
his
fall
when
he
reached
the
deck
he
came
bouncing
on
a
tall
stout
irishman
named
tom
smith
who
not
imagining
the
cause
of
so
rough
and
sudden
an
assault
roared
out
as
they
both
fell
together
on
the
deck
och
indeed
you
have
killed
me
here
however
he
was
mistaken
he
was
more
frightened
than
hurt
and
the
innocent
cause
of
his
fright
was
able
to
resume
his
duties
after
two
or
three
days’
respite
very
fortunately
for
my
back
the
unlucky
handspike
was
not
suspected
and
my
share
in
this
serio-comic
accident
remained
a
secret
within
my
own
breast
it
has
often
been
a
subject
of
surprise
to
my
mind
that
men
so
seldom
fall
from
the
tops
in
the
long
night-watches
they
keep
there
often
have
i
stood
two
hours
and
sometimes
when
my
shipmates
have
forgotten
to
relieve
me
four
long
tedious
hours
on
the
royal
yard
or
the
top-gallant
yard
without
a
man
to
converse
with
here
overcome
with
fatigue
and
want
of
sleep
i
have
fallen
into
a
dreamy
dozy
state
from
which
i
was
roused
by
a
lee
lurch
of
the
ship
starting
up
my
hair
has
stood
on
end
with
amazement
at
the
danger
i
had
so
narrowly
escaped
but
notwithstanding
this
sudden
fright
a
few
minutes
had
scarcely
elapsed
before
i
would
be
nodding
again
how
wonderful
that
more
are
not
swallowed
in
the
hungry
deep
when
the
weather
was
rough
we
were
indulged
with
permission
to
stand
on
the
fore-top-sail
yard
or
on
the
top-gallant
cross-trees
and
if
the
ship
rolled
heavily
we
lashed
ourselves
to
the
mast
for
greater
safety
i
can
assure
my
readers
there
is
nothing
desirable
in
this
part
of
a
sailor’s
duty
in
whatever
the
pleasure
of
a
life
at
sea
consists
it
is
not
in
keeping
a
look-out
from
the
mast-head
at
night
but
the
most
disagreeable
of
all
is
to
be
compelled
to
stand
on
these
crazy
elevations
when
half
dead
with
sea-sickness
some
suppose
that
sailors
are
never
sea-sick
after
the
first
time
they
go
to
sea
this
is
a
mistake
it
is
very
much
with
them
as
it
is
with
landsmen
in
respect
to
being
sick
in
a
coach
those
who
are
of
bilious
temperaments
are
always
affected
more
or
less
when
they
ride
in
a
stage
or
sleigh
while
others
are
never
sick
on
these
occasions
so
with
seamen
some
are
never
sea-sick
others
are
sick
only
when
going
out
of
port
while
some
are
so
in
every
gale
of
wind
mr
dana
mentions
some
of
the
crew
in
his
ship
who
were
sick
after
being
at
sea
two
years
as
they
came
to
boston
i
was
usually
sick
after
laying
some
time
in
port
and
have
often
stood
at
the
mast-head
when
so
sick
that
any
landsman
on
shore
in
a
similar
state
would
think
it
hard
if
he
could
not
lie
abed
for
a
sailor
there
is
no
allowance
made
for
sea-sickness
he
must
remain
at
his
post
until
it
is
time
to
be
relieved
when
we
entered
havana
we
came
to
anchor
near
the
spanish
fort
and
fired
a
salute
which
was
courteously
returned
by
the
spaniards
we
had
been
here
but
a
short
time
before
an
irishman
named
dougherty
who
had
formerly
deserted
from
the
spanish
garrison
took
it
into
his
head
to
run
away
from
our
brig
this
he
accomplished
by
the
assistance
of
some
spaniards
to
whom
he
made
himself
known
several
others
also
left
us
in
this
port
among
whom
was
our
swearing
sailing-master
and
a
great
deal
was
said
about
running
away
throughout
the
ship
the
man
who
was
flogged
on
suspicion
at
new
orleans
now
endeavored
to
get
off
in
reality
he
strayed
from
the
boat
but
the
officer
meeting
him
endeavored
to
force
him
back
he
resisted
a
struggle
ensued
the
officer
fell
to
the
ground
and
the
man
called
to
the
spaniards
to
assist
him
they
left
him
however
to
fight
his
own
battles
and
the
officer
having
succeeded
in
getting
the
advantage
presented
a
pistol
to
his
breast
and
he
surrendered
for
this
offence
he
was
flogged
most
fearfully
in
the
british
service
he
would
have
been
hung
it
is
certain
death
with
them
to
strike
an
officer
hearing
so
much
said
about
running
away
and
feeling
almost
as
unhappy
as
when
in
the
macedonian
i
began
to
think
of
it
myself
sometimes
i
thought
of
trying
to
get
into
the
spanish
garrison
as
a
soldier
at
others
of
joining
some
of
the
numerous
slavers
that
lay
there
and
in
which
our
men
said
a
good
chance
could
be
had
sad
chances
as
they
now
appear
especially
the
latter
but
i
was
young
and
ignorant
my
feelings
and
the
advice
and
opinion
of
my
shipmates
influenced
me
more
than
the
dictates
of
an
enlightened
understanding
resolving
to
make
a
trial
if
opportunity
offered
i
one
day
put
on
an
extra
shirt
and
drew
on
a
second
pair
of
pantaloons
when
thus
prepared
the
officer
of
the
deck
happened
to
discover
the
two
waistbands
of
my
trousers
he
questioned
me
with
a
suspicious
curiosity
i
told
him
as
specious
a
tale
as
i
could
invent
on
the
spot
which
was
that
i
had
been
mending
my
trousers
and
before
they
were
finished
was
called
to
go
ashore
in
the
boat
and
not
having
time
to
put
them
away
had
slipped
them
on
fortunately
a
needle
and
some
thread
which
i
had
about
me
confirmed
my
story
and
saved
me
from
difficulty
it
was
pretty
obvious
however
that
the
officer
though
silenced
was
not
satisfied
for
i
was
so
closely
watched
after
that
day
i
gave
up
the
idea
of
escape
as
utterly
futile
and
hopeless
from
havana
we
returned
to
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
where
we
captured
the
comet
a
patriot
schooner
on
suspicion
that
the
patriotism
of
her
crew
had
degenerated
into
something
less
respectable
harsh
as
it
must
have
sounded
in
the
ears
of
her
officers
we
charged
them
with
piracy
took
possession
of
the
vessel
and
brought
her
hands
as
prisoners
on
board
our
brig
her
master’s
name
was
mitchell
his
crew
were
all
stout
fierce-looking
blacks
having
all
sorts
of
odd
names
such
as
monday
friday
c
she
had
a
rich
cargo
and
contained
large
sums
of
money
it
was
reported
that
they
had
attacked
an
island
somewhere
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
murdered
its
governor
we
put
them
in
irons
with
sentries
over
them
who
were
charged
to
cut
off
their
heads
if
they
dared
to
lift
them
above
the
hatchway
i
performed
this
duty
a
part
of
the
time
parading
round
the
hatch
with
a
drawn
cutlass
but
they
showed
no
symptoms
of
resistance
and
were
sent
in
their
vessel
to
new
orleans
their
fate
i
never
ascertained
this
adventure
cost
one
of
our
own
crew
an
irishman
by
the
name
of
tom
smith
a
severe
flogging
smith
was
quite
a
moral
philosopher
in
his
way
though
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
his
philosophy
was
a
little
infected
with
lunacy
its
premises
were
certainly
sound
but
unfortunately
its
conclusions
bore
but
little
relation
to
the
parent
of
whom
they
boasted
he
taught
that
man
was
born
to
do
good
that
his
chief
good
was
the
promotion
of
his
own
interests
and
that
per
consequence
he
should
help
himself
to
whatever
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
without
regard
to
the
rights
of
others
with
these
views
tom
earnestly
defended
the
rightfulness
of
piracy
and
could
he
have
managed
to
get
on
board
a
pirate
vessel
or
even
have
contrived
to
wrest
our
own
ship
from
the
hands
of
her
officers
and
hoist
the
black
flag
he
would
have
cheerfully
done
so
but
somehow
although
he
had
made
a
number
of
disciples
among
his
shipmates
our
captain
paid
no
manner
of
respect
to
his
theories
for
when
tom
in
consistency
with
his
often
declared
principles
deliberately
carried
off
a
large
sum
of
money
from
our
capture
to
his
own
quarters
the
captain
who
perceived
the
theft
himself
ordered
him
to
the
gangway
and
administered
as
many
hard
lashes
as
if
tom
had
had
no
philosophy
at
all
but
although
tom
smith’s
philosophy
did
not
save
its
unlucky
advocate
from
the
unphilosophic
punishment
of
the
whip
it
nevertheless
exerted
a
baneful
influence
on
the
morals
of
our
crew
many
of
them
were
doubtless
bad
enough
when
they
came
on
board
but
a
more
complete
school
for
the
practise
of
iniquity
never
existed
than
that
on
board
our
brig
profanity
blasphemy
lying
licentious
conversation
and
even
a
system
of
petty
stealing
were
practised
on
a
large
scale
many
of
the
men
were
ripe
for
any
crime
within
the
power
of
depraved
humanity
to
commit
and
i
have
often
thought
that
even
the
decks
of
a
privateer
or
a
pirate
could
not
lead
one
faster
and
deeper
into
the
extremes
of
wickedness
than
did
the
influence
of
our
main
deck
with
what
a
voice
do
such
pictures
of
sailor
immorality
call
for
exertion
on
the
part
of
an
enlightened
christian
community
in
behalf
of
seamen
where
is
the
presence
of
the
meek
spirit
of
christianity
more
needed
than
on
the
decks
of
our
merchant
and
naval
vessels
where
would
missionaries
and
bibles
accomplish
more
than
here
there
is
no
sphere
of
christian
usefulness
so
important
so
promising
as
this
every
vessel
in
the
navy
should
have
its
chaplain
not
one
of
your
proud
fun-loving
graceless
wine-bibbers
but
a
humble
devoted
man
who
would
not
think
it
beneath
his
dignity
to
mingle
with
the
common
sailors
as
a
pastor
among
the
flock
of
his
affections
moulding
their
rough
but
susceptible
natures
into
the
image
of
virtue
by
the
force
of
his
pious
example
and
the
influence
of
his
effectual
prayers
then
in
the
merchant
service
a
species
of
itinerant
missionary
might
be
indefinitely
useful
he
might
be
sent
out
by
a
society
pledged
for
his
support
and
by
permission
of
the
owners
sail
in
a
ship

her
outward
passage
arrived
at
her
port
he
might
sail
to
another
place
in
a
different
ship
and
then
return
home
in
a
third
in
this
way
a
score
of
devoted
men
of
the
right
stamp

exert
an
unparalleled

after
a
short
stay
at
the
balize
we
put
to
sea
once
more
for
the
purpose
as
it
was
understood
of
touching
at
havana
and
then
returning
to
new
york
this
was
a
cheerful
voyage
the
idea
of
a
speedy
return
to
america
spread
a
feeling
of
exquisite
delight
over
the
whole
crew
and
converted
the
performance
of
our
duty
into
a
pleasure
one
effect
was
to
set
those
hands
who
were
gifted
with
the
talent
so
highly
prized
in
a
man
of
war
of
spinning
yarns
busily
at
work
during
every
spare
moment
when
a
group
could
be
gathered
to
listen
foremost
among
these
intellectual
time-killers
was
richard
dickinson
a
messmate
of
mine
a
good-natured
englishman
he
called
himself
the
son
of
old
dick
by
which
epithet
he
was
usually
called
dick’s
powers
were
now
in
great
demand
and
he
exercised
them
to
our
universal
satisfaction
but
with
how
great
regard
for
truth
i
cannot
determine
it
is
probable
however
that
truth
entered
very
little
into
dick’s
productions
he
was
a
sort
of
off-hand
novelist
all
he
cared
for
was
effect
and
where
truth
failed
him
fiction
generously
loaned
her
services
so
bewitching
were
dick’s
stories
that
i
used
to
long
for
the
hour
when
we
could
lay
in
our
hammocks
and
listen
my
first
salutation
when
we
lay
for
the
last
time
in
the
port
of
havana

dick
tell
us
a
yarn
what
is

use
you
will
go

used
to

no
i
won’t
dick
i
can
listen
to
your
yarns
all
night
was
my
usual
answer
dick
would
then
begin
some
yarn
which
if
not
so
interesting
as
the
thousand-and-one
stories
in
the
arabian
nights’
entertainments
was
at
least
as
true
to
nature
and
in
respect
to
its
humor
might
be
compared
to
some
of
the
sayings
of
that
illustrious
personage
sancho
panza
the
renowned
squire
of
the
immortal
don
quixote
but
in
spite
of
my
promises
i
usually
gave
notice
of
my
condition
after
a
short
time
by
performing
a
concord
of
nasal
sounds
vulgarly
called
snoring
which
would
set
dick
to
swearing
and
often
put
an
end
to
his
performances
for
the
night
i
need
scarcely
say
that
these
yarns
were
by
no
means
favorable
in
their
moral
effects
on
the
listener
they
generally
consisted
in
fictitious
adventures
on
the
sea
and
on
the
shore
plentifully
interlarded
in
their
recital
with
profane
oaths
and
licentious
allusions
when
seamen
become
elevated
and
are
properly
instructed
these
filthy
stories
will
be
superseded
by
reading
good
and
useful
literature
with
an
abundance
of
which
every
ship
should
be
supplied
by
the
benevolence
of
the
christian
public
on
the
passage
to
havana
dick
and
myself
fell
under
the
displeasure
of
the
captain
we
were
stationed
one
night
in
the
fore-top
where
we
were
comfortably
dozing
away
the
time
the
captain
was
on
deck
the
officer
of
the
watch
hailed
the
fore-top
we
did
not
hear
him
until
the
call
was
repeated
two
or
three
times
for
this
we
were
ordered
below
and
told
by
the
captain
that
we
should
be
flogged
the
next
day
before
the
whole
crew
with
this
consolatory
information
we
returned
to
our
station
without
the
least
inclination
to
sleep
again
for
that
watch
with
a
sort
of
philosophic
desperation
i
laughed
and
said
dick
which
would
you
rather
do--have
your
grog
stopped
awhile
or
take
a
flogging
dick
was
very
fond
of
his
grog
so
he
replied
oh
i
had
rather
they
would
stop
my
wind
than
my
grog
and
would
sooner
be
flogged
by
considerable
than
lose
that
i
question
however
if
he
had
been
left
to
choose
between
grog
and
whip
at
the
gangway
whether
he
would
not
have
altered
his
tone
in
favor
of
his
grog
still
his
answer
shows
how
strongly
sailors
are
attached
to
their
beloved
rum
i
am
happy
to
know
that
this
regard
is
dying
away
and
that
temperance
is
doing
something
among
sailors
may
it
go
on
until
cold
water
is
as
popular
in
a
man
of
war
as
grog
was
twenty
years
since
we
never
heard
however
of
our
offence
again
dick
was
quite
a
favorite
with
the
officers
and
except
a
blow
in
the
head
given
me
by
the
captain
i
had
never
been
punished
perhaps
these
were
the
reasons
why
we
escaped
the
gangway
at
havana
we
got
a
large
amount
of
spanish
dollars
aboard
for
some
merchants
in
new
york
these
were
smuggled
from
the
shore
our
men
were
sent
off
in
the
boats
with
their
pockets
and
bosoms
well
stuffed
with
the
precious
metal
and
in
this
way
we
soon
got
it
all
safely
lodged
in
our
hold
except
that
the
captain’s
servant
falling
desperately
in
love
with
them
furnished
himself
with
all
he
could
carry
and
ran
away
from
the
ship
after
adding
to
our
freight
of
dollars
a
fine
supply
of
oranges
lemons
pine-apples
c
we
cheerfully
weighed
anchor
and
set
sail
for
new
york
we
reached
that
port
after
a
short
and
prosperous
voyage
meeting
with
no
incident
except
that
the
cold
weather
caused
us
a
little
suffering
and
enabled
the
purser
to
add
a
few
dollars
to
the
profits
of
the
voyage
by
supplying
us
with
a
lot
of
red
flannel
shirts
when
i
was
on
board
the
siren
i
was
contented
the
officers
were
kind
the
crew
were
peaceful
and
well-behaved
but
in
the
boxer
some
of
the
officers
were
severe
and
the
crew
corrupt
and
i
did
not
enjoy
myself
at
all
some
said
that
in
time
of
war
the
men
were
better
treated
than
in
time
of
peace
but
though
this
may
be
true
to
a
limited
extent
yet
i
think
the
difference
in
these
two
brigs
was
owing
more
to
the
character
of
their
respective
officers
than
anything
else
be
this
as
it
may
my
experience
in
the
boxer
had
completely
sickened
me
of
man
of
war
life
and
i
determined
if
possible
to
get
free
of
it
at
once
and
forever
my
station
as
one
of
the
crew
of
the
jolly-boat
gave
me
frequent
opportunities
to
accomplish
my
purpose
so
one
day
at
the
solicitation
of
a
shipmate
i
resolved
to
make
the
attempt
cruel
treatment
was
my
excuse
yet
i
have
sometimes
been
ashamed
of
my
course
in
this
instance
and
would
heartily
advise
all
boys
in
the
naval
service
to
stay
their
time
out
we
were
successful
in
escaping
and
as
we
had
but
little
money
i
therefore
proceeded
directly
from
the
shore
to
a
pawn
shop
and
there
disposed
of
our
pea-jackets
which
were
new
and
for
which
the
purser
had
charged
us
ten
dollars
apiece
we
obtained
the
pitiful
sum
of
six
dollars
for
the
two
with
this
we
started
in
a
hack
which
was
to
carry
us
outside
of
the
city
we
then
travelled
hard
all
day
resting
at
night
in
a
barn
where
we
suffered
extremely
from
the
cold
the
next
day
we
pursued
our
way
towards
new
haven
the
day
after
we
were
still
on
the
road
this
was
the
sabbath
and
we
felt
strangely
at
seeing
the
good
people
of
the
village
through
which
we
passed
going
to
meeting
the
foot-stoves
that
the
grave
matrons
bore
in
their
hands
were
things
i
had
never
seen
before
so
to
the
great
merriment
of
my
companion
i
observed
that
they
were
excellent
contrivances
to
carry
their
books
in
to
meeting
we
reached
new
haven
on
monday
evening
where
we
put
up
at
a
sailors’
boarding-house
for
the
night
here
my
shipmate
left
me
and
i
proceeded
alone
to
hartford
begging
my
support
by
the
way
for
my
money
was
by
this
time
all
exhausted
at
hartford
i
tried
to
ship
on
board
some
merchant
vessel
not
succeeding
i
strove
to
find
some
one
to
take
me
as
an
apprentice
to
instruct
me
in
the
art
of
bootmaking
but
with
no
better
success
these
repulses
discouraged
me
it
was
christmas
day
and
the
associations
connected
with
the
day--the
merry-makings
of
my
early
boyhood--were
anything
but
pleasant
to
me
in
my
distress
the
bell
was
tolling
for
the
funeral
of
priest
strong
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
melancholy
of
the
mourners
fully
accorded
with
my
feelings
and
was
preferable
in
my
mind
to
the
spirit
of
rejoicing
that
prevailed
among
those
who
were
keeping
merry
christmas
in
merry
mood
perhaps
if
they
had
invited
me
to
partake
of
their
cheer
i
should
have
changed
my
opinion
as
it
was
with
only
five
cents
in
my
pocket
i
wandered
lonely
and
sad
through
the
city
with
a
feeling
of
despair
i
stepped
into
a
cellar
for
something
to
drink
they
charged
me
five
cents
and
left
me
at
once
friendless
and
penniless
at
the
bridge
the
toll-keeper
demanded
a
cent
i
looked
at
him
fiercely
and
told
him
i
had
nothing
he
let
me
pass
over
toll
free
towards
night
feeling
tired
and
hungry
i
endeavored
to
hire
myself
but
who
would
employ
an
utter
stranger
i
went
to
a
number
of
houses
imploring
a
lodging
for
the
night
with
freezing
coldness
i
experienced
repulse
after
repulse
until
my
heart
chilled
with
horror
with
the
fear
of
spending
that
long
cold
night
out
of
doors
at
last
i
called
on
a
kind-hearted
presbyterian
who
gave
me
a
supper
lodging
and
breakfast
their
morning
and
evening
devotions
were
peculiarly
interesting
to
me
for
excepting
while
a
prisoner
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
i
had
never
listened
to
an
extemporaneous
prayer
the
next
morning
i
left
this
truly
hospitable
family
and
pursued
my
inquiries
for
employment
some
asked
if
i
could
chop
wood
others
if
i
knew
anything
about
farming
and
when
i
answered
no
they
shook
their
heads
and
i
trudged
on
sometimes
i
offered
to
work
for
my
board
but
being
a
sailor
and
having
no
recommendations
people
were
afraid
to
take
me
into
their
families
still
i
pushed
on
a
man
overtook
me
in
the
town
of
coventry
and
began
a
very
interesting
and
faithful
discourse
about
religion
i
listened
respectively
he
took
me
home
with
him
where
although
he
was
a
deacon
he
gave
me
some
cider-brandy
but
these
were
not
the
days
of
temperance
after
this
he
sent
me
to
pomeroy’s
tavern
where
he
thought
they
would
hire
me
this
application
failing
he
advised
me
to
apply
at
the
glass
works
which
were
a
little
distance
from
that
place
with
this
advice
i
took
leave
of
deacon
cook
and
proceeded
towards
the
glass-houses
before
reaching
them
however
night
came
a
family
who
occupied
a
red
house
received
me
whose
hospitality
i
returned
by
singing
a
number
of
sea
songs
early
the
next
morning
i
tried
to
get
work
at
the
glass-house
but
though
i
was
willing
to
stay
for
my
board
they
would
not
take
me
mr
turner
the
agent
very
kindly
gave
me
a
breakfast
and
then
i
left
him
determined
to
get
to
boston
if
possible
and
go
to
sea
once
more
my
situation
was
really
a
trying
one
my
only
clothing
was
a
blue
jacket
and
trousers
shoes
more
than
half
worn
out
and
a
little
tarpaulin
hat
stuck
on
the
back
of
my
head
in
genuine
sailor
fashion.[27
mittens
and
money
were
alike
far
off
from
my
fingers
and
friends
were
as
scarce
as
money
people
too
seemed
afraid
of
a
sailor
and
this
in
addition
to
all
my
other
troubles
rendered
me
an
object
of
suspicion
at
such
times
i
assure
my
young
reader
that
the
picture
of
a
kind
mother
and
a
good
home
are
but
too
faithfully
presented
to
the
mind
filling
it
with
a
thousand
vain
and
useless
regrets
no
young
man
need
desire
to
be
in
the
outcast
prodigal
condition
in
which
i
stood
in
the
depth
of
that
cold
winter
when
i
reached
the
town
of
mansfield
i
called
at
the
house
of
a
mr
nathaniel
dunham
the
kind
manners
and
friendly
language
of
whose
lady
i
shall
never
forget
she
told
me
that
if
i
was
honest
providence
would
shortly
open
some
way
by
which
i
could
live
her
words
fell
on
my
ear
like
a
prophecy
and
i
left
the
house
confident
of
some
favorable
turn
in
my
affairs
before
long
at
mansfield
four
corners
i
inquired
of
dr
waldo
who
with
several
others
sat
under
a
piazza
and
afterwards
of
a
mr
edmund
freeman
for
employ
they
gave
me
no
encouragement
persevering
i
at
last
met
with
a
mr
peter
cross
who
seeing
my
sailor
garb
asked
what
ships
i
had
sailed
in
hearing
me
mention
the
macedonian
he
said
there
is
a
man
here
whose
name
is
william
hutchinson
he
was
taken
in
her
do
you
know
him
yes
said
i
after
a
moment’s
recollection
he
was
our
armorer’s
mate
of
course
i
lost
no
time
in
seeking
for
my
old
shipmate
after
crossing
various
lots
and
getting
vexed
and
perplexed
for
want
of
proper
direction
i
reached
his
comfortable
homestead
he
did
not
recognise
me
at
first
on
account
of
the
great
alteration
a
few
years
had
made
in
my
size
and
appearance
but
when
he
did
recall
me
to
his
recollection
with
the
generous
frankness
of
a
sailor
he
offered
me
all
the
hospitality
and
assistance
in
his
power
a
good
supper
was
speedily
spread
and
then
seated
before
his
ample
fireplace
sparkling
and
crackling
with
a
cheerful
blaze
we
recounted
our
adventures
he
had
wandered
into
connecticut
and
married
a
very
respectable
woman
they
now
owned
a
house
and
some
land
and
were
in
tolerably
comfortable
and
thriving
circumstances
with
such
discourse
we
talked
away
the
better
part
of
the
night
when
the
old
tar
showed
me
my
chamber
archly
observing
that
my
bed
would
not
rock
much
the
next
morning
he
said
i
should
not
leave
him
until
i
was
provided
for
in
some
way
or
other
through
his
influence
a
mr
james
his
brother-in-law
employed
me
to
work
in
his
cloth-dressing
establishment
as
i
was
ignorant
of
the
business
and
was
not
really
needed
my
board
was
to
be
my
only
compensation
my
new
situation
soon
grew
delightful
to
me
and
i
felt
happier
than
i
had
ever
done
since
i
left
bladen
my
time
passed
very
pleasantly
especially
my
evenings
when
the
neighbors
came
in
to
hear
me
spin
sea
yarns
and
forecastle
songs
some
of
the
young
men
of
the
baser
sort
judged
me
to
be
a
fit
instrument
to
act
samson
for
their
enjoyment
in
the
house
of
god
so
they
invited
me
to
attend
the
meetings
of
the
methodist
episcopal
church
in
that
place
but
they
greatly
misjudged
the
character
of
seamen
who
as
before
remarked
usually
pay
respect
to
the
ordinances
and
ministers
of
religion
i
attended
the
meeting
but
not
to
make
sport
the
result
of
this
ill-designed
invitation
on
myself
will
appear
hereafter
the
winter
months
fled
and
the
spring
found
me
unfurnished
with
means
co-extensive
with
my
wants
determined
to
remain
ashore
if
possible
i
hired
myself
to
a
farmer
for
my
board
in
the
evenings
i
braided
straw
hats
and
thus
obtained
a
scanty
supply
of
clothing
a
little
incident
illustrative
of
the
thoughtless
playfulness
of
sailor
character
may
not
be
displeasing
to
my
young
readers
whoever
has
seen
a
perfect
novice
undertake
to
guide
an
ox-team
may
form
some
idea
of
the
ludicrous
adventures
through
which
i
passed
during
my
agricultural
novitiate
with
these
horned
animals
perseverance
however
gave
me
some
little
control
over
our
team
when
as
fate
would
have
it
my
employer
swapped
them
for
another
pair
when
they
came
home
after
some
little
hallooing
and
whipping
i
succeeded
in
yoking
them
then
seizing
the
goad-stick
with
as
much
dignity
as
ever
neptune
wielded
his
trident
i
mounted
the
tongue
which
i
called
the
bowsprit
and
with
the
ladders
rigged
up
at
both
ends
i
gave
the
word
of
command
to
my
team
they
however
showed
signs
of
mutiny
and
taking
to
their
heels
bore
me
off
in
triumph
this
was
sport
indeed
there
i
stood
my
head
and
shoulders
passed
between
the
front
rigging
laughing
as
if
my
sides
would
burst
while
rakes
forks
and
boards
were
playing
leap-frog
at
the
tail
of
my
cart
and
my
master’s
boy
was
half
frightened
out
of
his
wits
at
length
the
angry
voice
of
my
master
roused
me
from
my
sportive
mood
he
did
not
relish
the
rough
usage
his
farming
tools
were
receiving
and
coming
up
with
my
horned
steeds
he
speedily
stopped
their
speed
and
my
sport
i
need
only
add
that
his
rebukes
made
me
more
careful
afterwards
when
the
haying
season
commenced
i
left
my
first
employer
and
obtained
the
sum
of
eight
dollars
per
month
and
board
the
wages
however
in
accordance
with
the
true
yankee
method
of
making
money
out
of
everything
were
to
be
payable
at
the
village
store
this
change
led
me
into
a
situation
which
proved
another
link
in
the
chain
which
ended
in
my
conversion
to
god
the
son
of
my
employer
died
he
was
about
fourteen
years
of
age
in
company
with
a
pious
member
of
the
methodist
church
i
sat
up
one
night
with
the
corpse
with
the
faithfulness
of
a
true
christian
he
improved
the
occasion
by
seriously
conversing
with
me
on
the
great
concerns
of
immortality
his
discourse
together
with
the
funeral
services
had
a
very
softening
and
gracious
influence
on
my
feelings
though
the
only
present
practical
effect
was
a
more
punctual
attendance
on
the
services
of
the
sanctuary
towards
winter
i
went
to
live
with
mr
joseph
conant
to
learn
the
business
of
filing
augers
and
steelyards
here
my
acquaintance
was
considerably
enlarged
as
several
young
men
were
attached
to
the
establishment
among
them
was
one
who
made
a
profession
of
religion
as
is
usual
among
the
young
we
were
devoted
triflers
and
he
to
my
astonishment
was
as
jocose
and
merry
as
the
rest
ignorant
as
i
was
of
religion
his
conduct
appeared
strangely
inconsistent
i
wondered
he
did
not
converse
with
me
about
my
soul
one
day
i
took
him
aside
and
faithfully
expressed
my
views
of
his
conduct
he
acknowledged
his
guilt
afterwards
we
attended
meetings
in
company
and
he
was
faithful
in
speaking
with
me
about
the
things
that
belonged
to
my
salvation
he
urged
upon
me
the
importance
of
giving
myself
up
to
god
at
once
and
affectionately
invited
me
to
attend
class-meeting
my
mind
was
seriously
inclined
but
i
could
not
yet
venture
upon
so
close
an
intercourse
with
the
people
of
god
one
sabbath
evening
my
friend
ela
dunham
who
had
dealt
so
faithfully
with
me
when
we
watched
together
over
the
corpse
of
orson
kidder
asked
me
when
do
you
intend
to
set
out
and
seek
religion
i
replied
somewhat
evasively
any
time
well
said
he
are
you
willing
we
should
pray
for
you
and
will
you
go
forward
for
prayers
to-night
to
this
i
replied
that
i
would
think
of
it
the
meeting
proved
to
be
intensely
interesting
my
desire
to
express
the
inward
workings
of
my
mind
grew
strong
of
the
forms
and
practices
of
christians
in
revivals
i
was
altogether
ignorant
having
never
witnessed
a
conversion
in
my
life
still
it
seemed
to
me
highly
proper
to
declare
my
feelings
in
the
presence
of
christians
that
they
might
give
such
instructions
as
were
necessary
to
lead
me
into
the
right
way
with
these
views
i
determined
to
rise
and
speak
though
the
evil
one
whispered
not
yet
not
yet
in
my
ears
just
as
i
stood
up
some
one
not
seeing
me
began
to
sing
this
i
took
to
be
a
suitable
excuse
for
further
delay
and
sat
down
heartily
wishing
that
no
one
had
seen
me
fortunately
my
friend
dunham
had
witnessed
my
movement
he
requested
them
to
stop
singing
because
a
young
man
wished
to
speak
thus
encouraged
i
told
them
i
was
then
nineteen
years
of
age
and
it
seemed
to
me
too
much
of
life
to
spend
in
sin
that
eternity
was
a
solemn
idea
and
i
desired
them
to
tell
me
how
to
prepare
to
enter
upon
it
with
joy
they
proposed
to
pray
with
me
we
then
all
kneeled
down
together
most
fervently
did
they
pray
for
the
divine
blessing
to
rest
on
the
stranger
youth
bowed
in
penitence
before
them
and
most
sincerely
did
i
join
my
prayers
with
theirs
before
the
throne
of
god
after
prayer
they
sung
the
following
familiar
lines
which
i
insert
both
for
their
intrinsic
excellence
and
for
the
pleasantness
of
the
associations
connected
with
them
in
my
own
mind
alas
and
did
my
saviour
bleed
and
did
my
sovereign
die
would
he
devote
that
sacred
head
for
such
a
worm
as
i
o
the
lamb
the
loving
lamb
the
lamb
on
calvary
the
lamb
that
was
slain
yet
lives
again
to
bleed
and
die
for
me
although
these
words
were
very
sweetly
applied
to
my
mind
i
did
not
feel
any
evidence
of
the
favor
of
god
that
night
the
next
day
with
a
strong
purpose
to
live
for
eternity
i
entered
on
my
daily
tasks
religion
was
the
theme
of
my
thoughts
and
discourse
during
the
day
a
sweet
calm
came
over
me
peace
and
joy
filled
my
soul
it
was
the
pardoning
love
of
god
applied
to
my
guilty
spirit
ah
thought
i
this
must
be
religion
but
desiring
to
be
right
i
went
to
my
employer
and
communicated
my
feelings
to
him
his
reply
rather
damped
my
joy
he
was
a
moralist
morality
he
said
was
all-sufficient
to
secure
a
man’s
well
being
both
in
this
life
and
in
that
to
come
this
however
did
not
satisfy
my
mind
to
me
it
seemed
certain
that
genuine
repentance
and
a
change
of
heart
were
all-essential
to
my
happiness
and
these
if
not
already
mine
i
determined
to
possess
the
remarks
and
experience
of
the
methodists
at
their
prayer
meetings
were
greatly
blessed
to
my
comfort
gradually
the
light
broke
the
day-star
shone
peace
like
a
river
filled
my
breast
joy
as
from
an
unfailing
fountain
bubbled
up
within
me
love
animated
my
affections
by
day
and
by
night
i
sang
the
praises
of
god
and
the
society
of
christ’s
dear
people
seemed
precious
indeed
to
my
soul
i
thought
this
sweet
frame
would
last
forever
i
determined
it
should
so
far
as
my
efforts
were
necessary
for
its
continuance
alas
i
knew
not
my
own
heart
a
dreary
wilderness
state
was
before
me
and
i
like
many
an
unwary
soul
before
me
heedlessly
stumbled
into
its
gloomy
shadows
by
a
sudden
change
in
the
condition
of
my
employer
i
was
led
to
seek
employment
in
ashford
here
in
the
shop
of
mr
giles
stebbins
i
was
surrounded
by
many
light-minded
trifling
young
men
falling
into
the
same
snare
for
which
i
had
reproved
a
professor
before
i
was
converted
my
peace
and
calm
were
lost
every
evidence
darkened
and
the
wretchedness
of
a
backslider
in
heart
filled
my
soul
this
apostacy
lasted
several
months
when
through
the
love
and
long-suffering
of
a
gracious
god
i
was
once
more
restored
to
a
state
of
salvation
since
that
time
though
i
have
not
gained
all
that
is
desirable
and
that
is
offered
in
an
abundant
gospel
yet
i
have
been
trying
to
stem
the
torrent
of
iniquity
which
runs
through
the
earth
and
striving
to
make
my
way
to
the
port
of
glory
the
next
fall
i
walked
eighteen
miles
to
a
camp-meeting
in
thompson
conn
the
first
i
had
ever
attended
though
the
scene
was
novel
i
soon
took
a
deep
interest
in
the
services
especially
when
informed
that
a
sailor
was
going
to
preach
one
evening
this
sailor
was
no
other
than
the
well-known
rev
e
t
taylor.[28
his
text
was
in
philippians
iv
19
but
my
god
shall
supply
all
your
needs
which
he
handled
in
his
usual
happy
and
eccentric
powerful
manner
i
had
never
before
seen
a
religious
sailor
to
hear
one
preach
therefore
in
such
forcible
and
effective
style
was
to
me
a
source
of
unutterable
delight
nor
were
the
listening
masses
before
the
stand
who
hung
with
intense
eagerness
on
his
lips
less
pleased
than
myself
they
broke
out
into
loud
expressions
of
praise
to
god
for
his
wonderful
mercies
this
said
the
speaker
is
but
a
drop
from
a
bucket
what
will
it
be
when
we
drink
from
the
mighty
ocean
itself
at
this
meeting
i
saw
sinners
yielding
to
christ
with
tears
of
sacred
penitence
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
never
in
all
my
life
had
a
spectacle
more
sublimely
beautiful
met
my
eye
i
do
not
believe
the
world
affords
a
more
grateful
sight
than
that
of
a
sinner
weeping
and
repenting
before
his
creator
the
parting
scene
of
that
meeting
left
an
indelible
impression
on
my
memory
even
now
i
see
that
affectionate
company
marching
in
regular
and
joyful
procession
before
the
stand
each
shaking
hands
as
he
passed
with
the
preachers
still
i
feel
the
tears
chasing
each
other
down
my
cheeks
as
i
grasped
the
hand
of
the
sailor
preacher
so
firmly
that
it
seemed
i
should
never
let
it
go
while
he
seeing
my
emotion
observed
never
mind
brother
we
are
on
board
of
zion’s
ship
now
i
had
stood
tearless
alike
amidst
the
wailings
of
the
tempest
and
the
roar
of
the
battle
but
here
among
a
few
christians
at
a
camp-meeting
my
heart
was
soft
as
a
woman’s
and
my
tears
flowed
like
rain
does
the
reader
inquire
what
made
the
difference
i
answer
it
was
the
love
of
god
when
i
returned
home
one
of
my
first
acts
was
to
unite
myself
with
the
methodist
episcopal
church
an
act
which
has
led
to
the
formation
of
many
pleasant
friendships
and
which
has
proved
the
source
of
much
religious
enjoyment
to
my
soul
my
mind
often
reverts
with
a
mixture
of
joy
and
sorrow
to
the
fate
of
the
three
hundred
men
and
boys
who
sailed
with
me
in
the
macedonian
when
i
left
england
for
the
first
time
of
these
alas
how
many
perished
in
battle
the
rest
were
scattered
over
the
four
quarters
of
the
globe
beside
myself
i
never
heard
of
but
one
of
them
who
embraced
religion
this
was
john
wiskey
one
of
our
quartermasters
he
settled
in
new
london
and
when
he
met
in
class
for
the
first
time
he
said
he
blessed
god
he
had
got
out
of
that
floating
hell
the
macedonian
he
afterwards
removed
to
catskill
on
the
north
river
where
he
maintained
a
good
christian
reputation
my
shipmate
who
received
me
so
hospitably
in
mansfield
became
unfortunate
lost
his
property
and
died
but
not
before
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
offering
a
prayer
at
his
bedside
the
little
fellow
who
escaped
from
the
macedonian
with
me
met
with
a
melancholy
fate
this
i
learned
one
day
from
the
following
paragraph
in
a
newspaper
drowned
out
of
a
pilot
boat
off
charleston
bar
mr
james
day
one
of
the
crew
of
his
britannic
majesty’s
late
frigate
macedonian
thus
have
i
been
signally
favored--a
brand
plucked
from
the
fire
for
this
special
favor
i
hope
to
render
my
heavenly
father
the
eternal
tribute
of
a
grateful
heart

during
the
various
scenes
dangers
and
wanderings
of
these
years
of
my
youth
i
had
not
forgotten
the
home
of
my
boyhood
and
now
that
i
was
becoming
somewhat
settled
in
my
prospects
i
wrote
an
affectionate
letter
to
my
mother
after
a
delay
of
several
months
i
received

letters

from

other
from
my
sister

to
the

may
fancy
that
his

feel
no
very
great

1818
my
dearly
beloved
child
i
cannot
describe
the
sensations
i
felt
when
i
received
a
letter
from
your
dear
hands
it
was
the
greatest
pleasure
i
have
enjoyed
since
you
left
me
i
have
never
been
sorry
but
once
since
you
left
and
that
has
been
ever
since
but
i
hope
the
almighty
has
ordered
it
all
for
the
best
i
have
never
forgotten
to
pray
for
you
morning
night
and
many
times
in
the
day
though
i
talked
very
little
about
you
to
any
one
because
i
did
not
wish
to
make
any
one
else
uncomfortable
but
that
god
who
knows
the
secrets
of
all
hearts
sees
how
sincerely
thankful
i
am
because
he
has
been
pleased
to
hear
my
prayers
that
i
might
hear
from
you
again
for
i
was
fearful
i
never
should
but
now
i
have
great
hopes
that
the
blessed
lord
will
protect
you
and
spare
our
lives
to
see
each
other
again
my
dear
child
you
have
not
stated
how
you
came
to
be
separated
from
the
crew
when
the
ship
was
taken
nor
how
you
have
been
employed
since
you
must
be
the
best
judge
whether
it
will
be
safe
for
you
to
venture
home
it
would
be
a
great
pleasure
for
me
to
see
you
but
if
there
is
danger
of
bad
consequences
on
account
of
your
having
been
in
the
service
against
your
country
and
if
any
bad
consequence
should
follow
your
coming
home
it
would
make
me
more
unhappy
than
i
have
ever
been
yet
if
there
is
no
danger
i
should
be
very
happy
to
have
you
come
home
and
learn
a
trade
as
thank
god
i
have
it
in
my
power
to
do
something
for
you
and
nothing
shall
be
wanting
to
make
you
comfortable
that
i
can
do
you
say
it
may
be
one
or
two
years
before
you
come
but
pray
come
the
first
opportunity
as
you
will
be
gladly
received
by
us
all
if
it
is
a
want
of
money
that
prevents
you
from
coming
and
you
cannot
work
your
passage
perhaps
you
can
get
one
by
showing
the
captain
of
some
ship
my
letter
and
he
may
depend
on
being
paid
as
soon
as
you
arrive
in
england
if
neither
will
do
send
me
word
and
if
there
is
any
place
in
london
where
your
passage
money
can
be
paid
i
will
pay
it
there
for
you
you
are
right
in
supposing
yourself
twenty-two
years
of
age
on
the
nineteenth
of
march
1819
your
sister
maria
is
twenty
she
is
grown
a
fine
young
woman
i
am
happy
to
say
is
very
steady
and
thoughtful
though
not
of
a
very
strong
constitution
she
is
at
service
in
london
she
has
written
to
you
and
i
hope
you
will
receive
her
letter
with
this





i
hope
my
dear
child
you
will
not
fail
to
come
home
send
me
all
the
particulars
of
your
life
at
the
first
opportunity
i
am
afraid
you
have
gone
through
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
hardship
since
i
saw
you
but
the
merciful
lord
has
been
pleased
to
bring
you
through
the
whole
and
he
is
able
to
carry
you
through
more
if
you
put
your
trust
in
him
it
gave
me
great
comfort
to
hear
that
you
are
so
well
disposed
as
i
am
sure
you
are
from
the
spirit
of
your
letter
it
was
more
pleasure
to
me
than
if
you
had
gained
all
the
riches
in
the
world
i
wish
i
was
as
well
acquainted
with
religion
as
yourself
but
i
will
try
to
make
a
better
use
of
my
time
and
should
it
please
god
to
let
you
come
home
i
hope
you
will
be
the
means
of
great
good
to
me
there
are
a
number
of
methodist
meetings
about
us
the
people
who
live
in
our
yard
are
very
strict
ones
i
never
disliked
the
methodists
i
think
they
have
a
great
gift
of
religion
i
sent
your
letter
to
lady
churchill
formerly
lady
francis
spencer
both
lord
and
lady
churchill
were
glad
to
hear
from
you
and
are
your
well-wishers
the
duke
and
duchess
of
marlborough
are
both
dead
blenheim
is
much
altered
for
the
worse
since
his
son
has
become
duke
lord
francis
that
was
makes
a
very
good
master
and
when
the
duke
died
he
left
blenheim
his
country
house
is
in
the
forest
your
father
is
his
carpenter
in
the
timber
yard
he
has
filled
this
situation
six
weeks
he
comes
home
every
saturday
and
next
spring
they
are
going
to
place
me
and
the
children
in
a
lodge
near
him
we
hope
to
have
the
happiness
of
seeing
you
there





it
is
eight
years
the
twelfth
of
last
july
since
you
left
us



your
father
brothers
and
sisters
all
join
with
me
in
hearty
prayers
to
almighty
god
that
his
blessing
may
be
upon
you
and
if
it
is
his
blessed
will
we
shall
see
you
again
if
it
is
not
we
must
be
resigned
to
what
is
fitting
for
us
and
pray
that
we
may
all
meet
in
heaven
where
all
tears
shall
be
wiped
away
that
god
may
bless
you
my
dear
child
is
the
sincere
prayer
of
your
ever
loving
mother
susan
newman
notwithstanding
the
earnestness
of
my
mother’s
spirit
breathed
out
so
ardently
for
my
return
in
this
letter
i
dared
not
risk
myself
on
british
soil
her
expression
of
sorrow
if
bad
consequences
should
ensue
had
its
weight
in
determining
me
to
remain
but
a
conversation
with
the
celebrated
lorenzo
dow
who
had
recently
returned
from
his
english
tour
settled
the
question
he
said
he
had
seen
four
men
hung
who
like
me
had
been
in
the
service
of
some
other
country
after
deserting
from
their
own
this
was
quite
sufficient
for
much
as
i
longed
to
visit
the
homes
of
my
childhood
i
had
no
disposition
to
do
it
with
a
gallows
suspended
over
my
head
i
therefore
wrote
my
mother
that
not
having
a
regular
discharge
from
the
navy
it
would
be
best
for
me
to
continue
where
i
was
but
i
begged
them
to
seriously
think
of
emigrating
themselves
since
my
father-in-law
being
an
excellent
carpenter
could
do
well
in
new
england
alas
it
was
not
for
him
ever
to
consider
of
this
proposition
for
when
my
letter
arrived
they
were
performing
the
sad
obsequies
of
death
over
his
breathless
corpse
a
prevailing
fever
had
terminated
a
life
of
fifty-seven
years
after
a
sickness
of
two
weeks
my
mother
now
a
widow
the
second
time
after
twelve
years
of
pleasant
union
with
her
last
husband
thought
it
unfitting
at
her
time
of
life
to
venture
across
the
ocean
and
therefore
all
my
plans
for
collecting
my
relatives
on
american
soil
were
blasted
in
the
bud
perhaps
after
following
me
through
the
changes
of
my
life
at
sea
the
reader
may
feel
a
little
interest
in
knowing
how
i
succeeded
as
landsman
he
has
seen
me
escaping
the
breakers
that
met
me
on
my
first
approach
to
the
shore
and
now
if
his
patience
be
not
entirely
exhausted
he
may
pursue
my
fortunes
a
little
further
he
left
me
when
my
episode
about
home
led
him
away
from
the
thread
of
the
narrative
busily
at
work
as
a
filer
of
steel-yards
at
mansfield
conn
from
thence
i
returned
to
ashford
where
i
continued
a
year
or
two
at
last
doubting
the
stability
of
my
employer
and
fearing
lest
what
he
owed
me
might
be
lost
i
took
up
the
whole
in
the
shape
of
a
wagon
and
a
stock
of
steel-yards
then
purchasing
a
horse
i
travelled
from
place
to
place
to
sell
them
and
in
this
manner
got
into
a
business
which
i
have
followed
more
or
less
ever
since
after
acquiring
by
economy
and
diligence
a
few
hundred
dollars
i
opened
a
small
store
in
mansfield
with
the
intention
of
leading
a
still
more
settled
life
though
about
that
time
my
mind
was
strongly
exercised
with
a
desire
to
devote
myself
to
the
religious
benefit
of
seamen
my
sense
of
unfitness
for
so
great
a
work
at
last
prevailed
and
i
proceeded
with
my
plans
of
worldly
business
the
days
of
which
i
write
were
those
on
which
the
bright
star
of
temperance
had
scarcely
shone
ministers
deacons
christians
all
used
the
deadly
drinks
was
it
surprising
therefore
that
i
but
so
short
a
time
before
a
rum-loving
sailor
fell
into
the
common
current
and
became
a
rum-seller
no
it
was
not
strange
but
it
was
a
strange
a
glorious
display
of
restraining
grace
that
prevented
me
from
being
drawn
into
the
snare
i
was
thus
thoughtlessly
spreading
for
the
poor
drunkard
but
even
in
those
early
days
of
temperance
i
was
not
without
my
trials
of
mind
in
respect
to
the
unholy
traffic
once
when
at
hartford
making
purchases
for
my
store
of
which
rum
formed
no
inconsiderable
article
i
accidentally
heard
of
a
lecture
on
temperance
to
be
delivered
at
dr
hawes’s[29
church
this
was
the
first
discourse
on
the
subject
i
ever
heard
the
speaker
excited
a
deep
interest
in
my
mind
as
he
told
of
the
origin
of
rum
its
primary
costliness
and
rank
among
medicines
of
the
growth
of
distilleries
the
consequent
decline
in
its
price
and
the
attending
spread
of
drunkenness
so
deadly
a
plot
against
the
peace
of
the
world
he
said
could
only
have
been
contrived
in
hell
this
discourse
fell
like
a
light
on
some
dark
opaque
it
illuminated
my
understanding
disturbed
my
conscience
no
sleep
visited
my
eyes
that
night
duty
said
send
back
your
team
without
rum
in
the
morning
fear
of
men
public
opinion
interest
said
no
every
other
store-keeper
sells
it
and
so
may
you
the
latter
argument
prevailed
conscience
was
rebuked
the
rum
went
to
my
store
shortly
after
this
struggle
i
married
a
member
of
the
methodist
church
in
hartford
we
removed
to
somers
connecticut
where
i
continued
to
sell
rum
though
as
before
with
great
caution
and
with
much
inward
struggling
of
mind
at
last
i
could
hold
out
no
longer
and
in
spite
of
the
example
of
ministers
some
of
whom
often
drank
though
sparingly
at
my
house
in
spite
of
the
sneers
of
the
scornful
and
of
the
fear
of
loss
to
my
trade
i
gave
it
up
it
was
for
the
poor
untaught
sailor
to
set
the
example
of
sacrifice
to
the
store-keepers
of
somers
three
others
imitated
me
in
a
short
time
not
to
me
but
to
the
grace
of
god
be
the
glory
of
my
decision
and
resolution
i
can
assure
the
modern
rum-seller
whose
lashed
and
tortured
soul
still
cleaves
to
the
rum
barrel
and
the
toddy
stick
for
the
sake
of
the
profit
that
i
have
ever
regarded
that
act
as
among
the
best
of
my
life
finding
my
present
residence
ill
adapted
to
a
successful
prosecution
of
business
i
closed
up
my
concerns
and
removed
to
wilbraham
mass
the
place
of
my
present
abode
a
pleasant
town
but
which
is
rendered
more
so
by
the
very
superior
opportunities
it
affords
for
the
education
of
children
in
its
most
excellent
and
flourishing
academy
here
my
life
glided
pleasantly
and
quietly
along
affording
no
incidents
worthy
of
special
record
happiness
presided
at
my
domestic
board
prosperity
accompanied
my
temporal
enterprises
and
religion
reigned
as
the
ruling
genius
over
the
whole
my
ways
were
committed
unto
the
lord
and
he
directed
my
steps
for
which
i
praise
him
with
my
whole
heart
in
this
delightful
manner
several
years
fled
away
when
my
business
having
led
me
on
one
occasion
to
new
york
i
heard
that
my
old
ship
the
macedonian
was
in
port
animated
with
that
regard
for
an
old
ship
which
always
inspires
a
genuine
seaman
i
went
on
board
she
was
so
altered
i
scarcely
recognised
her
change
with
an
unsparing
hand
had
remodeled
the
decks
and
cabins
so
that
i
felt
somewhat
lost
where
once
every
timber
was
familiar
this
was
rather
a
disappointment
however
i
stood
on
the
spot
where
i
had
fought
in
the
din
of
battle
and
with
many
a
serious
reflection
recalled
the
horrors
of
that
dreadful
scene
the
sailors
on
witnessing
the
care
with
which
i
examined
every
thing
and
supposing
me
to
be
a
landsman
eyed
me
rather
closely
seeing
their
curiosity
i
said
shipmates
i
have
seen
this
vessel
before
to-day
probably
before
any
of
you
ever
did
the
old
tars
gathered
round
me
eagerly
listening
to
my
tale
of
the
battle
and
they
bore
patiently
and
with
becoming
gravity
the
exhortation
to
lead
a
religious
life
with
which
i
closed
my
address
they
appeared
to
be
very
susceptible
of
religious
feeling
as
indeed
sailors
are
generally
should
any
doubt
this
fact
let
them
hear
the
rev
mr
chase
in
new
york
or
rev
e
t
taylor
in
boston
in
whose
usually
crowded
houses
of
worship
the
face
of
the
rough
weather-beaten
son
of
the
ocean
may
be
seen
bedewed
with
penitential
tears
especially
at
the
church
of
the
latter
gentleman--than
whom
none
know
better
how
to
adapt
discourse
to
a
sailor’s
soul
during
the
flight
of
these
years
a
constant
correspondence
had
been
kept
up
between
me
and
my
mother
she
had
constantly
urged
me
to
revisit
my
native
land
to
remove
the
last
obstacle
she
addressed
a
letter
to
lady
churchill
to
ascertain
if
i
might
safely
return
she
sent
her
the
following
note
the
original
of
which
is
still
in
my
possession

nov

1821
mrs
newman
i
consulted
my
brother
william
upon
the
subject
on
which
you
wished
for
advice
as
neither
lord
c
nor
myself
could
undertake
to
answer
your
inquiry
and
i
am
glad
to
hear
from
him
the
following
explanation
in
reply
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
mrs
newman’s
son
from
coming
home
for
when
the
war
was
terminated
he
was
safe
even
if
he
had
entered
into
the
enemy’s
service
but
he
will
of
course
forfeit
the
pay
and
any
prize
money
due
to
him





i
am
much
yours

churchill
this
note
relieved
me
of
all
fear
but
now
it
had
become
no
small
undertaking
for
me
to
go
to
europe
to
go
alone
would
be
very
expensive
but
to
take
my
family
consisting
now
of
a
wife
and
three
children
was
much
more
so
hence
i
put
it
off
year
after
year
still
writing
and
begging
them
to
visit
me
when
the
late
lamented
dr
fisk[30
was
in
england
he
visited
my
mother
and
brother
and
related
to
them
some
of
the
facts
in
my
life
which
he
had
often
heard
me
mention
she
sent
me
two
silver
table
spoons
which
had
belonged
to
my
father
by
the
doctor’s
hands
my
mother
wrote
about
this
visit
of
that
great
good
man
with
evident
satisfaction
at
last
i
received
a
letter
from
home
which
decided
me
to
undertake
the
often
postponed
and
long
delayed
voyage
to
my
native
land
this
letter
stated
that
there
was
a
young
man
in
albany
with
whose
friends
they
were
all
well
acquainted
and
that
he
was
about
to
visit
his
mother
i
found
this
gentleman
whose
name
was
william
warrington
and
agreed
to
join
him
with
my
family
in
his
intended
voyage
this
agreement
made
we
set
about
making
preparations
for
the
undertaking
if
the
reader
desires
to
know
the
events
of
that
visit
he

weighed
down
under
a
pressure
of
despondency
arising
partly
from
temporary
illness
and
partly
from
the
greatness
of
the
enterprise
i
had
undertaken
and
whose
event
was
so
uncertain
i
left
wilbraham
on
thursday
morning
june
3d
1841
a
pleasant
passage
by
the
way
of
springfield
and
hartford
brought
us
into
new
york
early
the
next
morning
by
the
following
monday
the
7th
of
june
we
were
all
snugly
stowed
in
a
state-room
of
the
second
cabin[31
on
board
the
splendid
packet-ship
george
washington
bound
for
liverpool
before
we
sailed
however
i
was
fleeced
of
seven
dollars
by
the
cook
of
the
ship
as
passengers
in
the
second
cabin
we
had
the
privilege
of
furnishing
ourselves
with
provisions
for
the
sum
just
mentioned
the
cook
had
agreed
to
do
all
our
cooking
at
the
galley
insisting
however
on
being
paid
in
advance
because
he
averred
several
passengers
on
former
occasions
had
obtained
his
services
and
failed
to
pay
him
besides
he
wanted
to
leave
all
the
money
he
could
with
his
wife
these
arguments
were
of
course
unanswerable
and
i
paid
him
the
sum
demanded
judge
then
of
my
surprise
when
a
few
minutes
before
we
hauled
off
the
captain
engaged
another
cook
the
first
having
suddenly
made
himself
among
the
missing
should
the
reader
ever
have
occasion
to
voyage
he
may
profit
by
the
remembrance
of
this
anecdote
we
then
hauled
off
into
the
stream
towed
by
a
steamboat
we
soon
cleared
the
harbor
of
new
york
sandy
hook
speedily
lay
behind
us
the
pilot
wished
us
a
pleasant
voyage
and
away
we
dashed
into
the
wide
atlantic
buoyed
up
by
the
confidence
of
the
hope
that
a
few
weeks
would
behold
us
safely
landed
on
the
shores
of
dear
old
england
the
details
of
a
voyage
across
the
atlantic
have
been
so
often
laid
before
the
public
by
travellers
that
they
have
now
lost
most
of
that
interest
which
they
would
possess
were
they
less
familiar
i
shall
not
therefore
detain
the
reader
with
the
particulars
of
my
passage
except
to
quote
the
experience
of
one
day
from
my
journal
saturday
june
12th
went
on
deck
early
in
the
morning
found
it
very
warm
we
passed
two
ships
on
the
same
course
with
ourselves
i
saw
a
rainbow
on
our
starboard
quarter
which
reminded
me
of
the
old
saying
among
sailors
rainbow
in
the
morning
sailors
take
warning
it
was
then
blowing
a
stiff
breeze
from
the
west
all
the
sails
were
up
studding
sails
out
below
and
aloft
the
wind
increased
during
the
morning
with
rain
we
soon
had
heavy
thunder
with
sharp
lightning
the
weather
growing
squally
we
took
in
our
studding
sails

ship

fore
topsail
and
main

we
are
running
before
the
wind
like
a
race-horse
at
the
rate
of
twelve
knots
an
hour
two
o’clock
p
m
more
thunder
and
lightning
which
threatened
vengeance
on
our
poor
ship
the
lightning
is
very
sharp
we
have
no
conductor
up
it
plays
all
around
us
and
as
it
strikes
the
water
it
hisses
like
red-hot
iron
several
of
the
sailors
felt
a
shock
in
descending
the
rigging
especially
the
first
and
second
mates
we
expected
it
would
strike
us
every
moment
but
a
kind
providence
protected
us
the
sea
runs
very
high
and
the
ship
flies
about
as
if
crazy
we
have
two
men
at
the
helm
who
can
scarcely
keep
her
right
it
seems
that
she
will
pitch
under

moment

wind
has
shifted
and
the
weather
is
clearing
off
during
the
whole
of
this
gale
many
of
the
passengers
were
much
alarmed
and
some
of
them
spent
their
time
in
praying
and
crying
to
the
lord
how
strange
that
men
will
leave
their
eternal
interests
to
an
hour
of
danger
and
forget
them
again
the
moment
it
passes
away
the
first
sabbath
of
our
life
at
sea
by
permission
of
captain
barrows--who
by
the
way
was
a
very
gentlemanly
kind
commander--i
held
a
religious
meeting
on
the
quarter
or
poop-deck
my
audience
contained
all
the
cabin
passengers
with
most
of
those
in
the
steerage
the
captain
and
his
mates
together
with
most
of
the
crew
i
told
them
i
was
not
a
parson
but
i
would
talk
to
them
as
well
as
i
could
after
singing
and
prayer
i
spoke
from
jonah
i

alluding
among
other
things
to
the
late
storm
and
exhorting
them
not
to
trust
to
storm
religion
but
to
become
the
followers
of
god
from
genuine
principle
my
audience
favored
me
with
profound
attention
whether
they
were
benefitted
or
not
the
great
day
must
determine
it
was
in
this
same
ship
that
the
eloquent
robert
newton
returned
to
england
he
favored
her
crew
and
passengers
every
sabbath
of
the
voyage
with
one
of
his
excellent
and
powerful
discourses
the
following
sabbaths
owing
to
the
weather
and
adverse
circumstances
i
contented
myself
with
distributing
tracts
and
with
discoursing
personally
with
the
passengers
and
crew
on
the
26th
of
june
we
saw
the
irish
coast
on
our
weather-beam
and
on
the
evening
of
the
27th
we
came
to
an
anchor
off
liverpool
after
a
short
passage
of
twenty
days
here
a
steamboat
came
alongside
bringing
several
custom-house
officers
who
came
on
board
and
carrying
our
cabin
passengers
ashore
the
next
morning
we
hauled
into
the
magnificent
docks
of
this
celebrated
city
of
commerce
where
our
baggage
was
landed
under
the
spacious
sheds
that
surround
the
wharves
from
thence
it
was
conveyed
in
small
carts
drawn
by
donkeys
to
the
custom-house
for
inspection
this
tedious
process
over
the
passengers
separated
each
bound
to
his
respective
home
for
having
passed
the
ordeal
of
the
custom-house
every
man
is
left
at
full
liberty
to
go
whither
he
pleases
i
and
my
family
proceeded
to
a
tavern
contrasting
as
we
went
along
the
dark
dingy
aspect
of
liverpool
everywhere
discolored
by
the
fumes
of
coal-smoke
with
the
light
cheerful
aspect
of
our
american
cities
and
giving
the
preference
to
the
latter
notwithstanding
my
english
prejudices
the
next
morning
we
all
took
seats
in
the
railroad
cars
for
stafford
some
seventy
miles
distant
from
liverpool
after
passing
through
the
tunnel
under
the
city
of
more
than
a
mile
in
length
we
emerged
into
a
beautiful
country
adorned
on
all
sides
with
antique
buildings
and
rural
scenery
these
passed
before
us
like
the
scenes
in
a
panorama
and
by
ten
o’clock
a
m
we
reached
the
stopping-place
a
short
distance
from
stafford
here
we
were
literally
in
danger
of
being
torn
asunder
by
the
eagerness
of
two
hackmen
who
as
we
were
the
only
passengers
left
at
the
dépôt
were
especially
zealous
for
our
patronage
a
police
officer
one
of
whom
is
stationed
at
every
dépôt
on
the
road
speedily
relieved
us
from
their
importunity
stepping
up
he
asked
me
which
man
i
would
employ
pointing
to
one
of
them
the
other
dropped
my
baggage
and
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
at
the
door
of
my
brother-in-law
mr
william
tills
although
i
had
not
seen
my
sister
for
thirty
years
yet
no
sooner
did
she
see
me
than
throwing
her
arms
around
my
neck
she
exclaimed
oh
my
brother
i
need
not
add
that
our
reception
was
cordial
and
our
stay
with
them
characterized
by
every
trait
of
genuine
hospitality
the
town
was
alive
with
the
bustle
of
an
election
flags
and
streamers
were
floating
over
every
tavern-sign
and
public
building
men
women
and
children
crowded
the
streets
flushed
with
the
excitement
of
party
rivalry
while
the
continual
pealing
of
the
bells
added
a
vivacity
and
liveliness
to
the
scene
of
which
an
american
who
has
never
heard
the
merry
ding-dong
of
a
full
peal
of
bells
can
form
no
adequate
conception
by
five
o’clock
that
afternoon
the
polls
closed
and
the
ceremony
of
chairing
the
successful
candidates
took
place
first
came
a
band
of
music
playing
lively
airs
next
followed
the
members
elect
richly
dressed
with
ribbons
on
their
hats
and
seated
on
chairs
wreathed
with
flowers
and
ribbons
and
surrounded
with
banners
bearing
various
devices
these
chairs
were
borne
on
men’s
shoulders
who
proceeded
through
the
streets
amid
immense
cheering
from
the
crowds
who
followed
and
from
the
ladies
and
citizens
who
appeared
waving
their
handkerchiefs
from
the
windows
the
members
meanwhile
bowing
with
their
hats
in
their
hands
until
they
reached
the
spot
where
their
chaises
waited
to
convey
them
to
their
respective
homes
the
sight
was
one
of
great
interest
to
a
stranger
and
i
advise
every
american
who
visits
england
by
all
means
to
witness
an
election
day
if
possible
we
remained
with
my
brother-in-law
about
a
week
visiting
the
various
places
and
buildings
whose
antiquity
or
public
character
clothed
them
with
especial
interest
the
town
itself
contains
about
eleven
hundred
inhabitants
and
is
the
shire
town
of
the
county
of
staffordshire
its
chief
business
is
the
manufacture
of
shoes
among
its
ancient
buildings
are
the
remains
of
a
baronial
castle
whose
moss-covered
battlements
insensibly
conduct
the
meditations
of
the
beholder
back
to
the
days
of
feudal
grandeur
and
knightly
chivalry
st
mary’s
church
is
also
a
venerable
gothic
structure
of
solid
masonry
whose
walls
have
withstood
the
storms
and
changes
of
about
ten
centuries
they
were
about
to
expend
£10,000
in
repairing
the
dilapidations
of
time
i
heard
one
discourse
from
the
curate
and
was
especially
delighted
with
the
grandeur
and
sublimity
of
the
music
from
its
magnificent
organ
as
it
pealed
along
the
aisles
of
the
time-worn
building
with
an
effect
never
witnessed
in
our
smaller
and
more
modern
structures
in
america
here
also
is
the
county
prison
modelled
in
most
of
its
arrangements
after
the
state-prisons
of
america
it
contained
five
hundred
prisoners
a
lunatic
asylum
and
a
hospital
or
infirmary
for
the
poor
are
found
among
the
products
of
its
benevolence
the
former
contained
three
hundred
unfortunate
occupants
the
poor-house
is
a
large
commodious
building
constructed
of
brick
and
stone
surrounded
with
large
airy
yards
and
gardens
it
has
also
yards
or
courts
within
its
walls
used
as
play-grounds
for
the
children
the
order
within
was
excellent
every
room
looked
remarkably
neat
and
clean
the
children
were
comfortably
clothed
and
wore
an
air
of
satisfaction
and
contentment
the
whole
house
was
under
the
control
of
a
governor
and
matron
who
were
subject
to
the
inspection
of
the
board
of
overseers
chosen
by
the
people
one
excellent
rule
of
the
house
struck
me
as
being
very
useful
it
provided
for
the
admission
of
poor
travellers
to
a
supper
and
lodging
requiring
them
if
dirty
to
undergo
a
thorough
ablution
and
to
change
their
linen
in
the
morning
two
or
three
hours’
work
was
exacted
as
payment
and
they
were
suffered
to
depart
the
house
had
its
teacher
and
chaplain
and
altogether
i
thought
that
a
great
improvement
had
taken
place
in
the
poor-laws
of
the
country
having
been
so
long
away
from
england
everything
peculiarly
english
struck
me
with
almost
as
much
force
as
it
would
a
native
american
hence
my
feelings
revolted
at
the
sight
of
the
innumerable
beggars
and
vagrants
who
crowded
the
streets
italians
with
their
organs
white
mice
or
monkeys
poor
barefooted
children
with
their
baskets
of
matches
and
worse
than
either
houseless
families
imploring
a
crust
for
their
half-naked
little
ones
with
many
a
tale
of
sorrow
and
woe
were
sights
which
greeted
my
eye
and
pained
my
heart
every
day
a
sad
spectacle
indeed
and
one
which
robs
the
lustre
of
the
british
crown
of
many
a
brilliant
ray
the
true
glory
of
a
people
is
their
internal
prosperity
and
not
the
extension
of
their
territory
the
fifth
of
july
renewed
the
excitement
of
the
day
i
arrived
it
was
the
time
appointed
for
the
county
election
similar
scenes
to
those
before
described
took
place
accompanied
with
excessive
drunkenness
every
tavern
and
the
number
seemed
endless
was
crowded
mostly
with
the
laboring
classes
who
were
spending
their
hard-earned
pence
for
foaming
tankards
of
english
ale
the
favorite
beverage
of
john
bull
and
one
of
the
greatest
hindrances
to
the
progress
of
the
temperance
cause
in
that
country
though
it
is
hoped
that
the
triumphs
of
tee-totalism
will
ultimately
overcome
this
national
love
for
john
barleycorn
as
beer
is
humorously
called
in
the
old
song
after
spending
an
extremely
pleasant
week
in
stafford
we
bade
adieu
to
my
affectionate
sister
and
her
husband
and
aided
by
omnipotent
steam
we
soon
reached
the
great
manufactory
of
britain--birmingham
from
thence
we
took
stage
for
woodstock
subject
however
to
the
incessant
exactions
of
the
host
of
waiters
guards
and
coachmen
that
constantly
assail
the
traveller
in
england
with
a
request
to
be
remembered
for
every
little
service
rendered
the
country
through
which
we
rode
was
delightful
all
nature
wore
her
greenest
brightest
garments
the
roads
were
level
and
as
smooth
as
the
most
thorough
macadamizing
could
make
them
soon
after
seven
in
the
evening
the
stage
drew
up
at
the
marlborough
arms
the
very
hotel
from
whence
i
started
thirty
years
since
to
go
to
sea
the
first
object
that
arrested
my
eye
was
the
revered
form
of
my
mother
waiting
on
the
sidewalk
eager
to
embrace
her
much-loved
but
long-absent
son
springing
to
the
ground
i
felt
myself
locked
in
her
fond
embrace
that
was
a
moment
of
exquisite
enjoyment
both
to
me
and
to
my
mother
though
deeply
moved
she
maintained
a
calm
dignity
of
manner
in
a
few
moments
she
was
showing
the
way
with
the
agility
of
a
young
woman
leading
a
new-found
grand-child
in
each
hand
to
her
residence
which
was
close
at
hand
very
soon
we
were
all
seated
round
the
well-loaded
board
the
happiest
family
party
in
the
world
though
it
afforded
me
and
my
family
great
pleasure
to
visit
scenes
round
woodstock
and
bladen
which
had
been
familiar
to
me
in
my
boyhood
yet
as
the
description
would
only
prove
tedious
to
the
reader
it
is
omitted
a
brief
account
of
our
visit
to
oxford
so
celebrated
for
its
university
and
colleges
may
not
be
uninteresting
oxford
contains
nineteen
colleges
and
five
halls
of
these
we
visited
only
christ
church
and
lincoln
colleges
christ
church
is
the
largest
college
in
oxford
we
were
forcibly
struck
with
the
magnificence
of
the
octagonal
tower
which
is
over
the
principal
gateway
it
has
a
dome
top
and
is
ornamented
in
the
gothic
style
from
designs
by
that
renowned
architect
sir
christopher
wren
it
is
also
remarkable
as
containing
the
celebrated
bell
known
by
the
familiar
name
of
great
tom
and
weighing
17,000
pounds
it
is
7
feet
1
inch
in
diameter
6
feet
9
inches
high
6⅛
inches
in
thickness
i
got
under
this
massive
piece
of
metal
and
found
abundant
room
to
move
about
by
standing
on
the
clapper
i
could
reach
the
top
over
my
head
this
is
the
largest
bell
in
england
though
russia
contains
several
of
a
much
larger
size
i
also
gratified
myself
by
a
survey
of
the
splendid
picture
galleries
and
the
spacious
library
the
former
containing
some
of
the
finest
specimens
of
painting
in
the
country
and
the
latter
a
large
and
valuable
collection
of
books
manuscripts
prints
coins
c
i
made
inquiries
of
our
attendant
for
the
room
in
which
charles
wesley
studied
while
a
member
of
this
college
but
although
quite
communicative
on
other
subjects
he
manifested
a
peculiar
sensitiveness
on
this
and
i
declined
pressing
the
question
after
quitting
the
college
happening
to
pass
the
residence
of
the
wesleyan
minister
mr
rodgers
i
called
upon
him
and
related
to
him
how
the
porter
avoided
my
questions
he
smiled
and
said
that
they
regarded
the
wesleys
as
dissenters
and
would
therefore
do
them
no
honor
mr
rodgers
was
extremely
obliging
he
conducted
us
over
his
beautiful
chapel
and
then
bore
us
company
to
lincoln
college
where
he
pointed
out
the
room
in
which
john
wesley
studied
when
a
member
of
this
institution
he
also
showed
us
the
other
localities
of
oxford
made
sacred
to
me
by
their
association
with
the
person
of
wesley’s
grandfather
the
preaching
of
the
wesleys
themselves
and
the
studies
of
dr
coke
the
great
missionary
hero
of
the
methodist
church
he
then
led
us
into
broad
street
to
the
consecrated
spot
where
latimer
ridley
and
cranmer
sealed
their
faith
by
enduring
a
martyr’s
death
three
stones
mark
the
spot
where
their
ashes
fell
and
never
did
i
feel
a
holier
feeling
than
that
which
thrilled
my
heart
while
i
and
my
family
stood
on
those
time-worn
stones
the
spirits
of
the
martyrs
seemed
to
hover
around
us
breathing
the
same
high
religious
determination
into
our
minds
that
filled
their
own
bold
and
daring
spirits
that
moment
amply
repaid
us
for
all
the
toil
of
our
journey
home
the
following
sabbath
i
attended
the
chapels
of
the
wesleyans
at
woodstock
and
bladen
and
in
the
evening
had
the
pleasure
of
saying
a
word
to
my
old
bladen
associates
in
the
prayer-meeting
after
receiving
the
utmost
kindness
hospitality
and
evidences
of
friendship
from
my
family
and
friends
i
took
leave
of
them
forever
many
of
the
neighbors
with
my
mother
accompanied
me
to
woodstock
there
i
wished
her
adieu
and
when
the
coach
whirled
away
she
stood
following
us
with
her
eyes
the
last
of
the
company
until
a
projection
of
the
park
wall
hid
us
from
each
other
who
could
forbear
a
tear
in
such
a
moment
i
could
not
and
therefore
suffered
the
big
drops
to
roll
down
my
cheeks
at
will
there
is
a
luxury
in
such
grief
that
evening
beheld
us
rolling
through
hyde
park
into
the
city
of
london
where
i
tarried
a
few
days
with
my
brother
by
whom
i
was
very
cordially
entertained
here
also
i
found
several
cousins
in
prosperous
circumstances
whose
kindness
contributed
not
a
little
to
my
enjoyment
having
visited
st
paul’s
the
museum
madame
tussaud’s
magnificent
collection
of
wax
figures
and
other
curious
and
remarkable
places
i
took
a
trip
to
walthamstow
the
former
residence
of
my
aunt
turner
this
good
lady
was
dead
and
almost
forgotten
by
the
people
her
twenty-two
children
were
all
either
dead
or
wandering
the
neighbors
knew
not
whither
alas
for
the
mutations
of
time
a
walk
of
two
miles
farther
on
brought
us
to
wanstead
my
birth-place
here
everything
seemed
natural
though
great
changes
had
passed
over
the
people
since
i
lived
there
a
thoughtless
child
my
common
school
teacher
and
my
sunday
school
teacher
had
gone
to
their
spiritual
destiny
my
aunt
was
yet
alive
my
brother
asked
her
if
she
knew
me
peering
through
her
spectacles
and
summoning
up
the
imagery
of
the
past
she
at
length
called
to
mind
her
former
protégé
and
clasped
me
to
her
arms
with
evident
gratification
it
occasions
melancholy
feeling
to
see
the
ravages
of
time
on
the
persons
and
places
one
has
not
visited
for
years
after
a
hasty
visit
to
that
noble
home
for
the
worn-out
sailor
at
greenwich
and
a
glance
at
the
arsenal
at
woolwich
i
returned
to
london
we
next
visited
the
city
road
chapel
built
by
the
exertions
of
the
great
wesley
himself
the
sexton
told
us
that
when
that
wonderful
man
held
the
collection
plate
one
sabbath
it
was
thrice
filled
with
gold
by
the
enthusiastic
generosity
of
the
congregation
a
striking
example
of
his
personal
influence
over
his
hearers
after
examining
the
chapel
i
walked
over
the
parsonage
adjoining
and
while
standing
in
the
room
where
with
his
dying
lips
the
immortal
founder
of
methodism
exclaimed
the
best
of
all
is
god
is
with
us
i
felt
inspired
with
his
great
spirit
and
mentally
resolved
like
him
to
laboriously
live
that
like
him
i
might
triumphantly
die
from
this
sacred
chamber
i
visited
the
tombs
of
wesley
clarke
benson
watson
cooper
and
other
illustrious
men
of
the
departed
army
of
faithful
warriors
in
the
cause
of
christ
and
as
i
stood
over
their
ashes
my
heart
said
with
peter
on
the
mount
of
transfiguration
master
it
is
good
for
me
to
be
here
crossing
the
road
into
bunhill
fields
i
stood
before
the
tombstones
of
the
celebrated
dr
isaac
watts
and
the
less
learned
but
equally
renowned
john
bunyan
here
the
wicket
gate
the
wanderings
of
the
pilgrim
the
land
of
beulah
and
the
river
of
death
passed
vividly
before
my
mind’s
eye
until
overcome
with
a
rush
of
powerful
feeling
i
wept
and
walked
away
a
better
man
than
when
i
entered
those
solemn
resting-places
of
the
glorious
dead
the
time
allotted
for
my
visit
having
nearly
expired
my
mind
began
to
look
towards
the
country
of
my
adoption
filled
with
a
strong
desire
once
more
to
tread
its
free
soil
strong
as
is
the
love
of
home
it
was
not
strong
enough
to
induce
a
preference
in
my
mind
for
england
america
had
become
the
dearer
of
the
two
indeed
i
saw
so
many
unpleasant
things
amidst
the
grandeur
and
pageantry
of
the
rich
that
i
often
felt
disgusted
such
hosts
of
street
beggars
such
troops
of
poverty-stricken
children
such
a
mass
of
degraded
laborers
such
enormous
taxation
made
me
shrink
from
bearing
any
part
of
so
great
a
burden
and
desire
to
link
my
future
destiny
with
the
rising
fortunes
of
america
how
the
laborer
of
england
lives
with
such
low
wages
and
such
high
prices
for
the
staple
commodities
of
life
is
above
my
comprehension
meat
was
from
twelve
to
twenty-four
cents
per
pound
tea
from
one
to
two
dollars
coffee
from
twenty-five
to
forty
cents
and
other
things
in
proportion
to
this
add
the
intemperate
habits
of
the
poor
and
how
they
live
becomes
a
problem
i
know
not
how
to
solve
yet
with
all
this
poverty
and
woe
taxation
is
laid
upon
the
public
with
merciless
severity
to
furnish
means
to
maintain
the
splendor
and
fatten
the
minions
of
royalty
first
they
have
to
pay
the
annual
interest
of
eight
hundred
million
pounds
then
come
the
enormous
salaries
of
the
monarch
and
the
satellites
of
the
throne
the
queen
for
her
private
purse

the

£20,000
the
bishops
an
average
of
£20,000
each
besides
these
follow
sinecures
and
pensions
innumerable
until
the
resources
of
the
nation
are
preyed
on
by
the
throne
with
the
unsatisfied
appetite
of
the
grave--taking
all
and
still
crying
give
give
i
felt
happy
when
beholding
these
things
that
providence
had
after
many
trials
in
early
life
cast
my
lot
in
america
on
the
25th
of
august
we
all
sailed
from
london
in
the
cabin
of
a
fine
ship
commanded
by
captain
eldridge
bound
for
boston
the
particulars
of
our
stormy
and
tedious
voyage
would
neither
gratify
nor
amuse
the
reader
and
they
are
therefore
omitted
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
atlantic
passage
could
scarcely
be
more
unpleasant
than
it
was
to
us
but
by
the
care
of
divine
providence
after
being
seventy-five
days
at
sea
exposed
to
every
variety
of
wind
and
weather
deprived
of
religious
advantages
and
surrounded
only
by
the
ungodly
we
safely
landed
and
found
comfortable
quarters
at
the
united
states
hotel
in
boston
from
thence
we
proceeded
to
worcester
and
then
to
wilbraham
where
we
were
hailed
with
joyful
congratulations
by
our
neighbors
who
had
begun
to
mourn
us
as
among
the
lost
at
sea
most
gratefully
did
we
all
unite
with
the
minister
the
following
sabbath
in
a
thank-offering
to
almighty
god
for
his
goodness
in
preserving
us
from
the
dangers
of
the
stormy
sea
thus
courteous

i
have
conducted
thee

the

my
labors

not

been
in

thee

my

a

hearing

the
prisoners

up

poor
affectionate

ill-judging
mother
singled
out
her
son

embracing
him
said

you

that

would
be

youth
